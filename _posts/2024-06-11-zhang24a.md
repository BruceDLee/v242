title: Learning to stabilize high-dimensional unknown systems using Lyapunov-guided
  exploration
abstract: Designing stabilizing controllers is a fundamental challenge in autonomous
  systems, particularly for high-dimensional, nonlinear systems that can hardly be
  accurately modeled with differential equations. The Lyapunov theory offers a solution
  for stabilizing control systems, still, current methods relying on Lyapunov functions
  require access to complete dynamics or samples of system executions throughout the
  entire state space. Consequently, they are impractical for high-dimensional systems.
  This paper introduces a novel framework, LYapunov-Guided Exploration (LYGE), for
  learning stabilizing controllers tailored to high-dimensional, unknown systems.
  LYGE employs Lyapunov theory to iteratively guide the search for samples during
  exploration while simultaneously learning the local system dynamics, control policy,
  and Lyapunov functions. We demonstrate its scalability on highly complex systems,
  including a high-fidelity F-16 jet model featuring a 16D state space and a 4D input
  space. Experiments indicate that, compared to prior works in reinforcement learning,
  imitation learning, and neural certificates, LYGE reduces the distance to the goal
  by 50% whil<e requiring only 5% to 32% of the samples. Furthermore, we demonstrate
  that our algorithm can be extended to learn controllers guided by other certificate
  functions for unknown systems.
