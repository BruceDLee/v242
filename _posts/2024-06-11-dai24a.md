title: Physically Consistent Modeling & Identification of Nonlinear Friction with
  Dissipative Gaussian Processes
booktitle: Proceedings of the 6th Annual Learning for Dynamics \& Control Conference
abstract: Friction modeling has always been a challenging problem due to the complexity
  of real physical systems. Although a few state-of-the-art structured data-driven
  methods show their efficiency in nonlinear system modeling, deterministic passivity
  as one of the significant characteristics of friction is rarely considered in these
  methods. To address this issue, we propose a Gaussian Process based model that preserves
  the inherent structural properties such as passivity. A matrix-vector physical structure
  is considered in our approaches to ensure physical consistency, in particular, enabling
  a guarantee of positive semi-definiteness of the damping matrix. An aircraft benchmark
  simulation is employed to demonstrate the efficacy of our methodology. Estimation
  accuracy and data efficiency are increased substantially by considering and enforcing
  more structured physical knowledge. Also, the fulfillment of the dissipative nature
  of the aerodynamics is validated numerically.
