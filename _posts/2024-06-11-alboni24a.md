  Optimization'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 6th Annual Learning for Dynamics \& Control Conference
abstract: Trajectory Optimization (TO) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) are powerful
  and complementary tools to solve optimal control problems. On the one hand, TO can
  efficiently compute locally-optimal solutions, but it tends to get stuck in local
  minima if the problem is not convex. On the other hand, RL is typically less sensitive
  to non-convexity, but it requires a much higher computational effort. Recently,
  we have proposed CACTO (Continuous Actor-Critic with Trajectory Optimization), an
  algorithm that uses TO to guide the exploration of an actor-critic RL algorithm.
  In turns, the policy encoded by the actor is used to warm-start TO, closing the
  loop between TO and RL. In this work, we present an extension of CACTO exploiting
  the idea of Sobolev learning. To make the training of the critic network faster
  and more data efficient, we enrich it with the gradient of the Value function, computed
  via a backward pass of the differential dynamic programming algorithm. Our results
  show that the new algorithm is more efficient than the original CACTO, reducing
  the number of TO episodes by a factor ranging from 3 to 10, and consequently the
  computation time. Moreover, we show that CACTO-SL helps TO to find better minima
  and to produce more consistent results.
