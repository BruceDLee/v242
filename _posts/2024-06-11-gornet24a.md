title: Restless Bandits with Rewards Generated by a Linear Gaussian Dynamical System
booktitle: Proceedings of the 6th Annual Learning for Dynamics \& Control Conference
abstract: Decision-making under uncertainty is a fundamental problem encountered frequently
  and can be formulated as a stochastic multi-armed bandit problem. In the problem,
  the learner interacts with an environment by choosing an action at each round, where
  a round is an instance of an interaction. In response, the environment reveals a
  reward, which is sampled from a stochastic process, to the learner. The goal of
  the learner is to maximize cumulative reward. In this work, we assume that the rewards
  are the inner product of an action vector and a state vector generated by a linear
  Gaussian dynamical system. To predict the reward for each action, we propose a method
  that takes a linear combination of previously observed rewards for predicting each
  action’s next reward. We show that, regardless of the sequence of previous actions
  chosen, the reward sampled for any previously chosen action can be used for predicting
  another action’s future reward, i.e. the reward sampled for action 1 at round $t-1$
  can be used for predicting the reward for action $2$ at round $t$. This is accomplished
  by designing a modified Kalman filter with a matrix representation that can be learned
  for reward prediction. Numerical evaluations are carried out on a set of linear
  Gaussian dynamical systems and are compared with 2 other well-known stochastic multi-armed
  bandit algorithms.
