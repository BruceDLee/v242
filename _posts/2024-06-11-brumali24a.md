title: A Deep Learning Approach for Distributed Aggregative Optimization with Users’
  Feedback
abstract: We propose a novel distributed data-driven scheme for online aggregative
  optimization, i.e., the framework in which agents in a network aim to cooperatively
  minimize the sum of local timevarying costs each depending on a local decision variable
  and an aggregation of all of them. We consider a ”personalized” setup in which each
  cost exhibits a term capturing the user’s dissatisfaction and, thus, is unknown.
  We enhance an existing distributed optimization scheme by endowing it with a learning
  mechanism based on neural networks that estimate the missing part of the gradient
  via users’ feedback about the cost. Our algorithm combines two loops with different
  timescales devoted to performing optimization and learning steps. In turn, the proposed
  scheme also embeds a distributed consensus mechanism aimed at locally reconstructing
  the unavailable global information due to the presence of the aggregative variable.
  We prove an upper bound for the dynamic regret related to (i) the initial conditions,
  (ii) the temporal variations of the functions, and (iii) the learning errors about
  the unknown cost. Finally, we test our method via numerical simulations.
