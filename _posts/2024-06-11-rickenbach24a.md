title: Inverse Optimal Control as an Errors-in-Variables Problem
booktitle: Proceedings of the 6th Annual Learning for Dynamics \& Control Conference
abstract: Inverse optimal control (IOC) is about estimating an unknown objective of
  interest given its optimal control sequence. However, truly optimal demonstrations
  are often difficult to obtain, e.g., due to human errors or inaccurate measurements.
  This paper presents an IOC framework for objective estimation from multiple sub-optimal
  demonstrations in constrained environments. It builds upon the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker
  optimality conditions, and addresses the Errors-In-Variables problem that emerges
  from the use of sub-optimal data. The approach presented is applied to various systems
  in simulation, and consistency guarantees are provided for linear systems with zero
  mean additive noise, polytopic constraints, and objectives with quadratic features.
