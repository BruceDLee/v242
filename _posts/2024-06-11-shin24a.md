title: On task-relevant loss functions in meta-reinforcement learning
abstract: Designing a competent meta-reinforcement learning (meta-RL) algorithm in
  terms of data usage remains a central challenge to be tackled for its successful
  real-world applications. In this paper, we propose a sample-efficient meta-RL algorithm
  that learns a model of the system or environment at hand in a task-directed manner.
  As opposed to the standard model-based approaches to meta-RL, our method exploits
  the value information in order to rapidly capture the decision-critical part of
  the environment. The key component of our method is the loss function for learning
  both the task inference module and the system model. This systematically couples
  the model discrepancy and the value estimate, thereby enabling our proposed algorithm
  to learn the policy and task inference module with a significantly smaller amount
  of data compared to the existing meta-RL algorithms. The proposed method is evaluated
  in high-dimensional robotic control, empirically verifying its effectiveness in
  extracting information indispensable for solving the tasks from observations in
  a sample-efficient manner.
