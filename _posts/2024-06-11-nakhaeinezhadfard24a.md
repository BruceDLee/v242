title: Residual Learning and Context Encoding for Adaptive Offline-to-Online Reinforcement
  Learning
abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) allows learning sequential behavior
  from fixed datasets. Since offline datasets do not cover all possible situations,
  many methods collect additional data during online fine-tuning to improve performance.
  In general, these methods assume that the transition dynamics remain the same during
  both the offline and online phases of training. However, in many real-world applications,
  such as outdoor construction and navigation over rough terrain, it is common for
  the transition dynamics to vary between the offline and online phases. Moreover,
  the dynamics may vary during the online training. To address this problem of changing
  dynamics from offline to online RL we propose a residual learning approach that
  infers dynamics changes to correct the outputs of the offline solution. At the online
  fine-tuning phase, we train a context encoder to learn a representation that is
  consistent inside the current online learning environment while being able to predict
  dynamic transitions. Experiments in D4RL MuJoCo environments, modified to support
  dynamicsâ€™ changes upon environment resets, show that our approach can adapt to these
  dynamic changes and generalize to unseen perturbations in a sample-efficient way,
  whilst comparison methods cannot.
