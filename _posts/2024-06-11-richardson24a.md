title: Strengthened stability analysis of discrete-time Lurie systems involving ReLU
  neural networks
booktitle: Proceedings of the 6th Annual Learning for Dynamics \& Control Conference
abstract: This paper addresses the stability analysis of a discrete-time (DT) Lurie
  system featuring a static repeated ReLU nonlinearity. Such systems often arise in
  the analysis of recurrent neural networks and other neural feedback loops. Custom
  quadratic constraints, satisfied by the repeated ReLU, are employed to strengthen
  the standard Circle and Popov Criteria for this specific Lurie system. The criteria
  can be expressed as a set of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) with less restrictive
  conditions on the matrix variables. It is further shown that if the Lurie system
  under consideration has a unique equilibrium point at the origin, then this equilibrium
  point is in fact globally stable or unstable, meaning that local stability analysis
  will provide no additional benefit. Numerical examples demonstrate that the strengthened
  criteria achieve a desirable balance between reduced conservatism and complexity
  when compared to existing criteria.
