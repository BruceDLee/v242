title: An Invariant Information Geometric Method for High-Dimensional Online Optimization
abstract: Sample efficiency is crucial in optimization, particularly in black-box
  scenarios characterized by expensive evaluations and zeroth-order feedback. When
  computing resources are plentiful, Bayesian optimization is often favored over evolution
  strategies. In this paper, we introduce a full invariance oriented evolution strategies
  algorithm, derived from its corresponding framework, that effectively rivals the
  leading Bayesian optimization method in tasks with dimensions at the upper limit
  of Bayesian capability. Specifically, we first build the framework InvIGO that fully
  incorporates historical information while retaining the full invariant and computational
  complexity. We then exemplify InvIGO on multi-dimensional Gaussian, which gives
  an invariant and scalable optimizer SynCMA . The theoretical behavior and advantages
  of our algorithm over other Gaussian-based evolution strategies are further analyzed.
  Finally, We benchmark SynCMA against leading algorithms in Bayesian optimization
  and evolution strategies on various high dimension tasks, including Mujoco locomotion
  tasks, rover planning task and synthetic functions. In all scenarios, SynCMA demonstrates
  great competence, if not dominance, over other algorithms in sample efficiency,
  showing the underdeveloped potential of property oriented evolution strategies.
