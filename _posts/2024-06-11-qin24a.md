title: Learning $\epsilon$-Nash equilibrium stationary policies in stochastic games with
  unknown independent chains using online mirror descent
abstract: 'We study a subclass of n-player stochastic games, namely, stochastic games
  with independent chains and unknown transition matrices. In this class of games,
  players control their own internal Markov chains whose transitions do not depend
  on the states/actions of other players. However, playersâ€™ decisions are coupled
  through their payoff functions. We assume players can receive only realizations
  of their payoffs, and that the players can not observe the states and actions of
  other players, nor do they know the transition probability matrices of their own
  Markov chain. Relying on a compact dual formulation of the game based on occupancy
  measures and the technique of confidence set to maintain high-probability estimates
  of the unknown transition matrices, we propose a fully decentralized mirror descent
  algorithm to learn an $\epsilon$-Nash equilibrium stationary policy for this class
  of games. The proposed algorithm has the desired properties of independence and
  convergence. Specifically, assuming the existence of a variationally stable Nash
  equilibrium policy, we show that the proposed algorithm in which players make their
  decisions independently and in a decentralized fashion converges asymptotically
  to the stable $\epsilon$-Nash equilibrium stationary policy with arbitrarily high
  probability.'
