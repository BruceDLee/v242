title: Learning flow functions of spiking systems
booktitle: Proceedings of the 6th Annual Learning for Dynamics \& Control Conference
abstract: We propose a framework for surrogate modelling of spiking systems. These
  systems are often described by stiff differential equations with high-amplitude
  oscillations and multi-timescale dynamics, making surrogate models an attractive
  tool for system design.We parameterise the flow function of a spiking system in
  state-space using a recurrent neural network architecture, allowing for a direct
  continuous-time representation of the state trajectories which is particularly advantageous
  for this class of systems.The spiking nature of the signals makes for a data-heavy
  and computationally hard training process, and we describe two methods to mitigate
  these difficulties. We demonstrate our framework on two conductance-based models
  of biological neurons.
