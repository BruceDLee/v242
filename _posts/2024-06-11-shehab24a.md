title: 'Learning true objectives: Linear algebraic characterizations of identifiability
  in inverse reinforcement learning'
abstract: Inverse reinforcement Learning (IRL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm
  for extracting expert skills from observed behavior, with applications ranging from
  autonomous systems to humanrobot interaction. However, the identifiability issue
  within IRL poses a significant challenge, as multiple reward functions can explain
  the same observed behavior. This paper provides a linear algebraic characterization
  of several identifiability notions for an entropy-regularized finite horizon Markov
  decision process (MDP). Moreover, our approach allows for the seamless integration
  of prior knowledge, in the form of featurized reward functions, to enhance the identifiability
  of IRL problems. The results are demonstrated with experiments on a grid world environment.
