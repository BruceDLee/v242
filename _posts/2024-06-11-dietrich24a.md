title: Nonconvex scenario optimization for data-driven reachability
abstract: 'Many of the popular reachability analysis methods rely on the existence
  of system models. When system dynamics are uncertain or unknown, data-driven techniques
  must be utilized instead. In this paper, we propose an approach to data-driven reachability
  that provides a probabilistic guarantee of correctness for these systems through
  nonconvex scenario optimization. We pose the problem of finding reachable sets directly
  from data as a chance-constrained optimization problem, and present two algorithms
  for estimating nonconvex reachable sets: (1) through the union of partition cells
  and (2) through the sum of radial basis functions. Additionally, we investigate
  numerical examples to demonstrate the capability and applicability of the introduced
  methods to provide nonconvex reachable set approximations.'
