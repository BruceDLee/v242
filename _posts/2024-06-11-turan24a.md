title: Safe dynamic pricing for nonstationary network resource allocation
abstract: This paper introduces the Safe Pricing for NUM with Gradual Variations (SPNUM-GV)
  algorithm, addressing challenges in pricing-based distributed resource allocation
  for safety-critical systems with non-stationary utility functions. Focusing on domains
  where 1) users’ optimal demand can only be induced through posted prices, 2) real-time
  two-way communication with the users is not available, 3) the induced demand must
  always belong to an arbitrarily shaped convex and compact feasible set in spite
  of price response uncertainty, and 4) the users’ response to prices are evolving
  over time, we design SPNUM-GV to generate prices that ensure stage-wise safety of
  the induced demand while achieving sublinear regret. SPNUM-GV ensures safety by
  determining a “desired demand” within a shrunk feasible set using a projected gradient
  method and updating the prices to induce a demand close to the desired demand by
  leveraging an estimate of the users’ price response function. By tuning the amount
  of shrinkage to account for the error between the desired and the induced demand,
  we prove that the induced demand always belongs to the feasible set. In addition,
  we prove that the regret incurred by the induced demand is $O(\sqrt{T(1+V_T)})$
  after $T$ iterations, where $V_T$ is an upper bound on the total gradual variations
  of the users’ utility functions. Numerical simulations demonstrate the efficacy
  of SPNUM-GV and support our theoretical findings.
