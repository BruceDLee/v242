title: Continual learning of multi-modal dynamics with external memory
abstract: We study the problem of fitting a model to a dynamical environment when
  new modes of behavior emerge sequentially. The learning model is aware when a new
  mode appears, but it cannot access the true modes of individual training sequences.
  The state-of-the-art continual learning approaches cannot handle this setup, because
  parameter transfer suffers from catastrophic interference and episodic memory design
  requires the knowledge of the ground-truth modes of sequences. We devise a novel
  continual learning method that overcomes both limitations by maintaining a descriptor
  of the mode of an encountered sequence in a neural episodic memory. We employ a
  Dirichlet Process prior on the attention weights of the memory to foster efficient
  storage of the mode descriptors. Our method performs continual learning by transferring
  knowledge across tasks by retrieving the descriptors of similar modes of past tasks
  to the mode of a current sequence and feeding this descriptor into its transition
  kernel as control input. We observe the continual learning performance of our method
  to compare favorably to the mainstream parameter transfer approach.
