title: 'STEMFold: Stochastic temporal manifold for multi-agent interactions in the
  presence of hidden agents'
abstract: Learning accurate, data-driven predictive models for multiple interacting
  agents following unknown dynamics is crucial in many real-world physical and social
  systems. In many scenarios, dynamics prediction must be performed under incomplete
  observations, i.e., only a subset of agents are known and observable from a larger
  topological system while the behaviors of the unobserved agents and their interactions
  with the observed agents are not known. When only incomplete observations of a dynamical
  system are available, so that some states remain hidden, it is generally not possible
  to learn a closed-form model in these variables using either analytic or data-driven
  techniques. In this work, we propose STEMFold, a spatiotemporal attention-based
  generative model, to learn a stochastic manifold to predict the underlying unmeasured
  dynamics of the multi-agent system from observations of only visible agents. Our
  analytical results motivate STEMFold design using a spatiotemporal graph with time
  anchors to effectively map the observations of visible agents to a stochastic manifold
  with no prior information about interaction graph topology. We empirically evaluated
  our method on two simulations and two real-world datasets, where it outperformed
  existing networks in predicting complex multiagent interactions, even with many
  unobserved agents.
