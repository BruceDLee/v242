title: Multi-agent coverage control with transient behavior consideration
abstract: This paper studies the multi-agent coverage control (MAC) problem where
  agents must dynamically learn an unknown density function while performing coverage
  tasks. Unlike many current theoretical frameworks that concentrate solely on the
  regret occurring at specific targeted sensory locations, our approach additionally
  considers the regret caused by transient behavior â€“ the path from one location and
  another. We propose the multi-agent coverage control with the doubling trick (MAC-DT)
  algorithm and demonstrate that it achieves (approximated) regret of $\widetilde
  O(\sqrt{T})$ even when accounting for the transient behavior. Our result is also
  supported by numerical experiments, showcasing that the proposed algorithm manages
  to match or even outperform the baseline algorithms in simulation environments.
  We also show how our algorithm can be modified to handle safety constraints and
  further implement the algorithm on a real-robotic testbed.
