title: Verification of neural reachable tubes via scenario optimization and conformal
  prediction
abstract: Learning-based approaches for controlling safety-critical autonomous systems
  are rapidly growing in popularity; thus, it is important to provide rigorous and
  robust assurances on their performance and safety. Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability
  analysis is a popular formal verification tool for providing such guarantees, since
  it can handle general nonlinear system dynamics, bounded adversarial system disturbances,
  and state and input constraints. However, it involves solving a Partial Differential
  Equation (PDE), whose computational and memory complexity scales exponentially with
  respect to the state dimension, making its direct use on large-scale systems intractable.
  To overcome this challenge, neural approaches, such as DeepReach, have been used
  to synthesize reachable tubes and safety controllers for high-dimensional systems.
  However, verifying these neural reachable tubes remains challenging. In this work,
  we propose two different verification methods, based on robust scenario optimization
  and conformal prediction, to provide probabilistic safety guarantees for neural
  reachable tubes. Our methods allow a direct trade-off between resilience to outlier
  errors in the neural tube, which are inevitable in a learning-based approach, and
  the strength of the probabilistic safety guarantee. Furthermore, we show that split
  conformal prediction, a widely used method in the machine learning community for
  uncertainty quantification, reduces to a scenario-based approach, making the two
  methods equivalent not only for verification of neural reachable tubes but also
  more generally. To our knowledge, our proof is the first in the literature to show
  a strong relationship between the highly related but disparate fields of conformal
  prediction and scenario optimization. Finally, we propose an outlier-adjusted verification
  approach that harnesses information about the error distribution in neural reachable
  tubes to recover greater safe volumes. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed
  approaches for the high-dimensional problems of multi-vehicle collision avoidance
  and rocket landing with no-go zones.
