title: Safe Learning in Nonlinear Model Predictive Control
abstract: A robust Model Predictive Control algorithm is proposed for learning-based
  control with model represented by an affine combination of basis functions. The
  online optimization is formulated as a sequence of convex programming problems derived
  by linearizing concave components of the dynamic model. A tube-based approach ensures
  satisfaction of constraints on control variables and model states while avoiding
  conservative bounds on linearization errors. The linear dependence of the model
  on unknown parameters is exploited to allow safe online parameter adaptation. The
  resulting algorithm is recursively feasible and provides closed loop stability and
  performance guarantees. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate the approach.
