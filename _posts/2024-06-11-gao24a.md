title: Learning-based rigid tube model predictive control
abstract: This paper is concerned with model predictive control (MPC) of discrete-time
  linear systems subject to bounded additive disturbance and mixed constraints on
  the state and input, whereas the true disturbance set is unknown. Unlike most existing
  work on robust MPC, we propose an algorithm incorporating online learning that builds
  on prior knowledge of the disturbance, i.e., a known but conservative disturbance
  set. We approximate the true disturbance set at each time step with a parameterised
  set, which is referred to as a quantified disturbance set, using disturbance realisations.
  A key novelty is that the parameterisation of these quantified disturbance sets
  enjoys desirable properties such that the quantified disturbance set and its corresponding
  rigid tube bounding disturbance propagation can be efficiently updated online. We
  provide statistical gaps between the true and quantified disturbance sets, based
  on which, probabilistic recursive feasibility of MPC optimisation problems is discussed.
  Numerical simulations are provided to demonstrate the efficacy and computational
  advantages of our proposed algorithm and compare with conventional robust MPC algorithms.
