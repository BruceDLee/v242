title: Mapping back and forth between model predictive control and neural networks
booktitle: Proceedings of the 6th Annual Learning for Dynamics \& Control Conference
abstract: Model predictive control (MPC) for linear systems with quadratic costs and
  linear constraints is shown to admit an exact representation as an implicit neural
  network. A method to “unravel” the implicit neural network of MPC into an explicit
  one is also introduced. As well as building links between model-based and data-driven
  control, these results emphasize the capability of implicit neural networks for
  representing solutions of optimisation problems, as such problems are themselves
  implicitly defined functions.
