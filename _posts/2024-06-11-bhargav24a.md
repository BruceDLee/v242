title: Submodular information selection for hypothesis testing with misclassification
  penalties
abstract: 'We consider the problem of selecting an optimal subset of information sources
  for a hypothesis testing/classification task where the goal is to identify the true
  state of the world from a finite set of hypotheses, based on finite observation
  samples from the sources. In order to characterize the learning performance, we
  propose a misclassification penalty framework, which enables non-uniform treatment
  of different misclassification errors. In a centralized Bayesian learning setting,
  we study two variants of the subset selection problem: (i) selecting a minimum cost
  information set to ensure that the maximum penalty of misclassifying the true hypothesis
  is below a desired bound and (ii) selecting an optimal information set under a limited
  budget to minimize the maximum penalty of misclassifying the true hypothesis. Under
  certain assumptions, we prove that the objective (or constraints) of these combinatorial
  optimization problems are weak (or approximate) submodular, and establish high-probability
  performance guarantees for greedy algorithms. Further, we propose an alternate metric
  for information set selection which is based on the total penalty of misclassification.
  We prove that this metric is submodular and establish near-optimal guarantees for
  the greedy algorithms for both the information set selection problems. Finally,
  we present numerical simulations to validate our theoretical results over several
  randomly generated instances.'
