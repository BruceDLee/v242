title: Balanced Reward-inspired Reinforcement Learning for Autonomous Vehicle Racing
abstract: Autonomous vehicle racing has attracted extensive interest due to its great
  potential in autonomous driving at the extreme limits. Model-based and learning-based
  methods are being widely used in autonomous racing. However, model-based methods
  cannot cope with the dynamic environments when only local perception is available.
  As a comparison, learning-based methods can handle complex environments under local
  perception. Recently, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has gained popularity in
  autonomous racing. DRL outperforms conventional learning- based methods by handling
  complex situations and leveraging local information. DRL algorithms, such as the
  proximal policy algorithm, can achieve a good balance between the execution time
  and safety in autonomous vehicle competition. However, the training outcomes of
  conventional DRL methods exhibit inconsistent correctness in decision-making. The
  instability in decision-making introduces safety concerns in autonomous vehicle
  racing, such as collisions into track boundaries. The proposed algorithm is capable
  to avoid collisions and improve the training quality. Simulation results on a physical
  engine demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms other DRL algorithms
  in achieving safer control during sharp bends, fewer collisions into track boundaries,
  and higher training quality among multiple tracks.
