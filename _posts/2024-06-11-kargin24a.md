title: Wasserstein Distributionally Robust Regret-Optimal Control over Infinite-Horizon
booktitle: Proceedings of the 6th Annual Learning for Dynamics \& Control Conference
abstract: We investigate the Distributionally Robust Regret-Optimal (DR-RO) control
  of discrete-time linear dynamical systems with quadratic cost over an infinite horizon.
  Regret is the difference in cost obtained by a causal controller and a clairvoyant
  controller with access to future disturbances. We focus on the infinite-horizon
  framework, which results in stability guarantees. In this DR setting, the probability
  distribution of the disturbances resides within a Wasserstein-2 ambiguity set centered
  at a specified nominal distribution. Our objective is to identify a control policy
  that minimizes the worst-case expected regret over an infinite horizon, considering
  all potential disturbance distributions within the ambiguity set. In contrast to
  prior works, which assume time-independent disturbances, we relax this constraint
  to allow for time-correlated disturbances, thus actual distributional robustness.
  While we show that the resulting optimal controller is non-rational and lacks a
  finite-dimensional state-space realization, we demonstrate that it can still be
  uniquely characterized by a finite dimensional parameter. Exploiting this fact,
  we introduce an efficient numerical method to compute the controller in the frequency
  domain using fixed-point iterations. This method circumvents the computational bottleneck
  associated with the finite-horizon problem, where the semi-definite programming
  (SDP) solution dimension scales with the time horizon. Numerical experiments demonstrate
  the effectiveness and performance of our framework.
