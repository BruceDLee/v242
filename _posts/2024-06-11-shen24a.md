title: Combining Model-based Controller and ML Advice via Convex Reparameterization
booktitle: Proceedings of the 6th Annual Learning for Dynamics \& Control Conference
abstract: 'Machine Learning (ML) based control, particularly Reinforcement Learning
  (RL), has achieved impressive advancements but is often black-box and lacks worst-case
  guarantees in safety-critical systems. In contrast, classical model-based control
  offers stability guarantees but usually underperforms the machine-learned black-box
  controller. This motivates us to combine machine-learned black-box and model-based
  controllers. Due to the nonconvexity of the space of stable controllers, a simple
  convex combination of the two controllers can lead to instability. We propose using
  Disturbance Response Control (DRC) to reparameterize the two controllers, ensuring
  the convexity of the stable controller space. We then propose lambdaCLEAC, which
  adaptively combines the machine-learned black-box controller and the model-based
  controller in the DRC parameterization. We prove that our approach achieves the
  best of both worlds: stability as in model-based control and similar regret bounds
  as the machine-learned controller.'
