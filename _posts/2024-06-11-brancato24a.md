title: In vivo learning-based control of microbial populations density in bioreactors
abstract: A key problem in using microorganisms as bio-factories is achieving and
  maintaining cellular communities at the desired density and composition to efficiently
  convert their biomass into useful compounds. Bioreactors are promising technological
  platforms for the real-time, scalable control of cellular density. In this work,
  we developed a learning-based strategy to expand the range of available control
  algorithms capable of regulating the density of a single bacterial population in
  bioreactors. Specifically, we used a sim-to-real paradigm, where a simple mathematical
  model, calibrated using a single experiment, was adopted to generate synthetic data
  for training the controller. The resulting policy was then exhaustively tested in
  vivo using a low-cost bioreactor known as Chi.Bio, assessing performance and robustness.
  Additionally, we compared the performance with more traditional controllers (namely,
  a PI and an MPC), confirming that the learning-based controller exhibits similar
  performance in vivo. Our work demonstrates the viability of learning-based strategies
  for controlling cellular density in bioreactors, making a step forward toward their
  use in controlling the composition of microbial consortia.
