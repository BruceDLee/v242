title: 'DC4L: Distribution Shift Recovery via Data-Driven Control for Deep Learning
  Models'
abstract: Deep neural networks have repeatedly been shown to be non-robust to the
  uncertainties of the real world, even to naturally occurring ones. A vast majority
  of current approaches have focused on data-augmentation methods to expand the range
  of perturbations that the classifier is exposed to while training. A relatively
  unexplored avenue that is equally promising involves sanitizing an image as a preprocessing
  step, depending on the nature of perturbation. In this paper, we propose to use
  control for learned models to recover from distribution shifts online. Specifically,
  our method applies a sequence of semantic-preserving transformations to bring the
  shifted data closer in distribution to the training set, as measured by the Wasserstein
  distance. Our approach is to 1) formulate the problem of distribution shift recovery
  as a Markov decision process, which we solve using reinforcement learning, 2) identify
  a minimum condition on the data for our method to be applied, which we check online
  using a binary classifier, and 3) employ dimensionality reduction through orthonormal
  projection to aid in our estimates of the Wasserstein distance. We provide theoretical
  evidence that orthonormal projection preserves characteristics of the data at the
  distributional level. We apply our distribution shift recovery approach to the ImageNet-C
  benchmark for distribution shifts, demonstrating an improvement in average accuracy
  of up to 14.21% across a variety of state-of-the-art ImageNet classifiers. We further
  show that our method generalizes to composites of shifts from the ImageNet-C benchmark,
  achieving improvements in average accuracy of up to 9.81%. Finally, we test our
  method on CIFAR-100-C and report improvements of up to 8.25%.
