title: Towards Safe Multi-Task Bayesian Optimization
booktitle: Proceedings of the 6th Annual Learning for Dynamics \& Control Conference
abstract: Bayesian optimization has emerged as a highly effective tool for the safe
  online optimization of systems, due to its high sample efficiency and noise robustness.
  To further enhance its efficiency, reduced physical models of the system can be
  incorporated into the optimization process, accelerating it. These models are able
  to offer an approximation of the actual system, and evaluating them is significantly
  cheaper. The similarity between the model and reality is represented by additional
  hyperparameters, which are learned within the optimization process. Safety is a
  crucial criterion for online optimization methods such as Bayesian optimization,
  which has been addressed by recent works that provide safety guarantees under the
  assumption of known hyperparameters. In practice, however, this does not apply.
  Therefore, we extend the robust Gaussian process uniform error bounds to meet the
  multi-task setting, which involves the calculation of a confidence region from the
  hyperparameter posterior distribution utilizing Markov chain Monte Carlo methods.
  Subsequently, the robust safety bounds are employed to facilitate the safe optimization
  of the system, while incorporating measurements of the models. Simulation results
  indicate that the optimization can be significantly accelerated for expensive to
  evaluate functions in comparison to other state-of-the-art safe Bayesian optimization
  methods, contingent on the fidelity of the models.
