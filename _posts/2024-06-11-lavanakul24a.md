title: Safety Filters for Black-Box Dynamical Systems by Learning Discriminating Hyperplanes
booktitle: Proceedings of the 6th Annual Learning for Dynamics \& Control Conference
abstract: 'Learning-based approaches are emerging as an effective approach for safety
  filters for black-box dynamical systems. Existing methods have relied on certificate
  functions like Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) and Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability
  value functions. The primary motivation for our work is the recognition that ultimately,
  enforcing the safety constraint as a control input constraint at each state is what
  matters. By focusing on this constraint, we can eliminate dependence on any specific
  certificate function-based design. To achieve this, we define a discriminating hyperplane
  that shapes the half-space constraint on control input at each state, serving as
  a sufficient condition for safety. This concept not only generalizes over traditional
  safety methods but also simplifies safety filter design by eliminating dependence
  on specific certificate functions. We present two strategies to learn the discriminating
  hyperplane: (a) a supervised learning approach, using pre-verified control invariant
  sets for labeling, and (b) a reinforcement learning (RL) approach, which does not
  require such labels. The main advantage of our method, unlike conventional safe
  RL approaches, is the separation of performance and safety. This offers a reusable
  safety filter for learning new tasks, avoiding the need to retrain from scratch.
  As such, we believe that the new notion of the discriminating hyperplane offers
  a more generalizable direction towards designing safety filters, encompassing and
  extending existing certificate-function-based or safe RL methodologies.'
