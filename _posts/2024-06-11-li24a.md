title: 'System-level Safety Guard: Safe Tracking Control through Uncertain Neural
  Network Dynamics Models'
abstract: The Neural Network (NN), as a black-box function approximator, has been
  considered in many control and robotics applications. However, difficulties in verifying
  the overall system safety in the presence of uncertainties hinder the deployment
  of NN modules in safety-critical systems. In this paper, we leverage the NNs as
  predictive models for trajectory tracking of unknown dynamical systems. We consider
  controller design in the presence of both intrinsic uncertainty and uncertainties
  from other system modules. In this setting, we formulate the constrained trajectory
  tracking problem and show that it can be solved using Mixed-integer Linear Programming
  (MILP). The proposed MILP-based approach is empirically demonstrated in robot navigation
  and obstacle avoidance through simulations. The demonstration videos are available
  at https://xiaolisean.github.io/publication/2023-11-01-L4DC2024.
