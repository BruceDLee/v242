title: Parameterized Fast and Safe Tracking (FaSTrack) using DeepReach
booktitle: Proceedings of the 6th Annual Learning for Dynamics \& Control Conference
abstract: Fast and Safe Tracking (FaSTrack) is a modular framework that provides safety
  guarantees while planning and executing trajectories in real time via value functions
  of Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability. These value functions are computed through
  dynamic programming, which is notorious for being computationally inefficient. Moreover,
  the resulting trajectory does not adapt online to the environment, such as sudden
  disturbances or obstacles. DeepReach is a scalable deep learning method to HJ reachability
  that allows parameterization of states, which opens up possibilities for online
  adaptation to various controls and disturbances. In this paper, we propose Parametric
  FaSTrack, which uses DeepReach to approximate a value function that parameterizes
  the control bounds of the planning model. The new framework can smoothly trade off
  between the navigation speed and the tracking error (therefore maneuverability)
  while guaranteeing obstacle avoidance in a priori unknown environments. We demonstrate
  our method through two examples and a benchmark comparison with existing methods,
  showing the safety, efficiency, and faster solution times of the framework.
