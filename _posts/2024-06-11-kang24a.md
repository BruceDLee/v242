title: 'Learning locally interacting discrete dynamical systems: Towards data-efficient
  and scalable prediction'
abstract: Locally interacting dynamical systems, such as epidemic spread, rumor propagation
  through crowd, and forest fire, exhibit complex global dynamics originated from
  local, relatively simple, and often stochastic interactions between dynamic elements.
  Their temporal evolution is often driven by transitions between a finite number
  of discrete states. Despite significant advancements in predictive modeling through
  deep learning, such interactions among many elements have rarely explored as a specific
  domain for predictive modeling. We present Attentive Recurrent Neural Cellular Automata
  (AR-NCA), to effectively discover unknown local state transition rules by associating
  the temporal information between neighboring cells in a permutation-invariant manner.
  AR-NCA exhibits the superior generalizability across various system configurations
  (i.e., spatial distribution of states), data efficiency and robustness in extremely
  data-limited scenarios even in the presence of stochastic interactions, and scalability
  through spatial dimension-independent prediction.
