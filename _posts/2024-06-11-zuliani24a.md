title: Convergence guarantees for adaptive model predictive control with kinky inference
abstract: We analyze the convergence properties of a robust adaptive model predictive
  control algorithm used to control an unknown nonlinear system. We show that by employing
  a standard quadratic stabilizing cost function, and by recursively updating the
  nominal model through kinky inference, the resulting controller ensures convergence
  of the true system to the origin, despite the presence of model uncertainty. We
  illustrate our theoretical findings through a numerical simulation.
