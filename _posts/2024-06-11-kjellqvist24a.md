title: Minimax dual control with finite-dimensional information state
booktitle: Proceedings of the 6th Annual Learning for Dynamics \& Control Conference
abstract: This article considers output-feedback control of systems where the function
  mapping states to measurements has a set-valued inverse. We show that if the set
  has a bounded number of elements, then minimax dual control of such systems admits
  finite-dimensional information states. We specialize our results to a discrete-time
  integrator with magnitude measurements and derive a surprisingly simple sub-optimal
  control policy that ensures finite gain of the closed loop. The sub-optimal policy
  is a proportional controller where the magnitude of the gain is computed offline,
  but the sign is learned, forgotten, and relearned online. The discrete-time integrator
  with magnitude measurements captures real-world applications such as antenna alignment,
  and despite its simplicity, it defies established control-design methods. For example,
  whether a stabilizing linear time-invariant controller exists for this system is
  unknown, and we conjecture that none exists.
