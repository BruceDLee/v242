title: Data-driven strategy synthesis for stochastic systems with unknown nonlinear
  disturbances
abstract: In this paper, we introduce a data-driven framework for synthesis of provably-correct
  controllers for general nonlinear switched systems under complex specifications.
  The focus is on systems with unknown disturbances whose effects on the dynamics
  of the system is nonlinear. The specification is assumed to be given as linear temporal
  logic over finite traces (LTLf) formulas. Starting from observations of either the
  disturbance or the state of the system, we first learn an ambiguity set that contains
  the unknown distribution of the disturbances with a user-defined confidence. Next,
  we obtain a robust Markov decision process (RMDP) as a finite abstraction of the
  system. By composing the RMDP with the automaton obtained from the LTLf formula
  and performing optimal robust value iteration on the composed RMDP, we synthesize
  a strategy that yields a high probability that the uncertain system satisfies the
  specifications. Our empirical evaluations on systems with a wide variety of disturbances
  show that the strategies synthesized with our approach lead to high satisfaction
  probabilities and validate the theoretical guarantees.
