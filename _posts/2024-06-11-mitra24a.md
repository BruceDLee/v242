title: Towards model-free LQR control over rate-limited channels
abstract: 'Given the success of model-free methods for control design in many problem
  settings, it is natural to ask how things will change if realistic communication
  channels are utilized for the transmission of gradients or policies. While the resulting
  problem has analogies with the formulations studied under the rubric of networked
  control systems, the rich literature in that area has typically assumed that the
  model of the system is known. As a step towards bridging the fields of model-free
  control design and networked control systems, we ask: Is it possible to
  solve basic control problems - such as the linear quadratic regulator (LQR) problem
  - in a model-free manner over a rate-limited channel? Toward answering this question,
  we study a setting where a worker agent transmits quantized policy gradients (of
  the LQR cost) to a server over a noiseless channel with a finite bit-rate. We propose
  a new algorithm titled Adaptively Quantized Gradient Descent (AQGD), and
  prove that above a certain finite threshold bit-rate, AQGD guarantees exponentially
  fast convergence to the globally optimal policy, with no deterioration of
  the exponent relative to the unquantized setting. More generally, our approach
  reveals the benefits of adaptive quantization in preserving fast linear convergence
  rates, and, as such, may be of independent interest to the literature on compressed
  optimization.'
