title: 'Uncertainty Quantification of Set-Membership Estimation in Control and Perception:
  Revisiting the Minimum Enclosing Ellipsoid'
abstract: Set-membership estimation (SME) outputs a set estimator that guarantees
  to cover the groundtruth. Such sets are, however, defined by (many) abstract (and
  potentially nonconvex) constraints and therefore difficult to manipulate. We present
  tractable algorithms to compute simple and tight overapproximations of SME in the
  form of minimum enclosing ellipsoids (MEE). We first introduce the hierarchy of
  enclosing ellipsoids proposed by Nie and Demmel (2005), based on sums-of-squares
  relaxations, that asymptotically converge to the MEE of a basic semialgebraic set.
  This framework, however, struggles in modern control and perception problems due
  to computational challenges. We contribute three computational enhancements to make
  this framework practical, namely constraints pruning, generalized relaxed Chebyshev
  center, and handling non-Euclidean geometry. We showcase numerical examples on system
  identification and object pose estimation.
