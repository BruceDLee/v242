title: Generalized Constraint for Probabilistic Safe Reinforcement Learning
booktitle: Proceedings of the 6th Annual Learning for Dynamics \& Control Conference
abstract: In this paper, we consider the problem of learning policies for probabilistic
  safe reinforcement learning (PSRL). Specifically, a safe policy or controller is
  one that, with high probability, maintains the trajectory of the agent in a given
  safe set. While the explicit gradient of the probabilistic constraint for solving
  PSRL directly exists, the high variance in the estimate of the gradient hinders
  its performance in problems with long-horizons. An alternative that is frequently
  explored in the literature is to consider a cumulative safe reinforcement learning
  (CSRL) setting. In this setting, the estimates of the constraintâ€™s gradient have
  less variance but are biased (worse solutions than the PSRL) and they provide an
  approximate solution since they solve a relaxation of the PSRL formulation. In this
  work, we propose a safe reinforcement learning framework with a generalized constraint
  for solving the PSRL problems, which we term Generalized Safe Reinforcement Learning
  (GSRL). Our theoretical contributions substantiate that the proposed GSRL can recover
  both the PSRL and CSRL settings. In addition, it can be naturally combined with
  any state-of-the-art safe RL algorithms like PPO-Lagrangian, TD3-Lagrangian, CPO,
  PCPO, etc. We evaluate the GSRL by a series of empirical experiments in the well-known
  safe RL benchmark Bullet-Safety-Gym, which exhibit a better return-safety trade-off
  than both the PSRL and CSRL formulations.
