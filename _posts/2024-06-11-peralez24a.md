title: 'Deep model-free KKL observer: A switching approach'
abstract: 'This paper presents a new model-free methodology to learn Kazantzis-Kravaris-Luenberger
  (KKL) observers for nonlinear systems. We address three major difficulties arising
  in observer design: the peaking phenomenon, the noise sensitivity and the trade-off
  between convergence speed and robustness. We formulate the learning objective as
  an optimization problem, strictly minimizing the error of the observer estimates,
  without the need of adding explicit constraints or regularization terms. We further
  improve the performance with a switching approach, efficiently transitioning between
  two observers, respectively designed for the transient phase and the asymptotic
  convergence. Numerical results on the Van der Pol system, the RÃ¶ssler attractor
  and on a bioreactor illustrate the gain of the method regarding the literature,
  in term of performance and robustness. Code available online: https://github.com/jolindien-git/DeepKKL'
