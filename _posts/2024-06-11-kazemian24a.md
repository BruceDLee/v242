title: Random Features Approximation for Control-Affine Systems
booktitle: Proceedings of the 6th Annual Learning for Dynamics \& Control Conference
abstract: Modern data-driven control applications call for flexible nonlinear models
  that are amenable to principled controller synthesis and realtime feedback. Many
  nonlinear dynamical systems of interest are control affine. We propose two novel
  classes of nonlinear feature representations which capture control affine structure
  while allowing for arbitrary complexity in the state dependence. Our methods make
  use of random features (RF) approximations, inheriting the expressiveness of kernel
  methods at a lower computational cost. We formalize the representational capabilities
  of our methods by showing their relationship to the Affine Dot Product (ADP) kernel
  proposed by Castaneda et al. (2021) and a novel Affine Dense (AD) kernel that we
  introduce. We further illustrate the utility by presenting a case study of data-driven
  optimization-based control using control certificate functions (CCF). Simulation
  experiments on a double pendulum empirically demonstrate the advantages of our methods.
