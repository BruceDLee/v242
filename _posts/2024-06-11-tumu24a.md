title: Multi-Modal Conformal Prediction Regions by Optimizing Convex Shape Templates
abstract: Conformal prediction is a statistical tool for producing prediction regions
  for machine learning models that are valid with high probability. A key component
  of conformal prediction algorithms is a non-conformity score function that quantifies
  how different a modelâ€™s prediction is from the unknown ground truth value. Essentially,
  these functions determine the shape and the size of the conformal prediction regions.
  However, little work has gone into finding non-conformity score functions that produce
  prediction regions that are multi-modal and practical, i.e., that can efficiently
  be used in engineering applications. We propose a method that optimizes parameterized
  shape template functions over calibration data, which results in non-conformity
  score functions that produce prediction regions with minimum volume. Our approach
  results in prediction regions that are multi-modal, so they can properly capture
  residuals of distributions that have multiple modes, and practical, so each region
  is convex and can be easily incorporated into downstream tasks, such as a motion
  planner using conformal prediction regions. Our method applies to general supervised
  learning tasks, while we illustrate its use in time-series prediction. We provide
  a toolbox and present illustrative case studies of F16 fighter jets and autonomous
  vehicles, showing an up to 68% reduction in prediction region area.
