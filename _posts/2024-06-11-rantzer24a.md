title: A data-driven Riccati equation
abstract: Certainty equivalence adaptive controllers are analysed using a “data-driven
  Riccati equation”, corresponding to the model-free Bellman equation used in Q-learning.
  The equation depends quadratically on data correlation matrices. This makes it possible
  to derive simple sufficient conditions for stability and robustness to unmodeled
  dynamics in adaptive systems. The paper is concluded by short remarks on how the
  bounds can be used to quantify the interplay between excitation levels and robustness.
