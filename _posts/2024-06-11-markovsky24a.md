title: The Behavioral Toolbox
abstract: The Behavioral Toolbox is a collection of Matlab functions for modeling,
  analysis, and design of dynamical systems using the behavioral approach to systems
  theory and control. It implements newly emerged direct data-driven methods as well
  as classical parametric representations of linear time-invariant systems. At the
  core of the toolbox is a nonparameteric representation of the finite-horizon behavior
  by an orthonormal basis. The current version has education and research goals and
  isn’t intended for handling “big data”. The paper presents five problems — checking
  systems equality, interconnection of systems, errors-in-variables least-squares
  smoothing, missing input estimation, and data-driven forecasting — and describes
  their solution by the methods in the toolbox.
