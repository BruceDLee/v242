title: Improving sample efficiency of high dimensional Bayesian optimization with
  MCMC
booktitle: Proceedings of the 6th Annual Learning for Dynamics \& Control Conference
abstract: Sequential optimization methods are often confronted with the curse of dimensionality
  in high-dimensional spaces. Current approaches under the Gaussian process framework
  are still burdened by the computational complexity of tracking Gaussian process
  posteriors and need to partition the optimization problem into small regions to
  ensure exploration or assume an underlying low-dimensional structure. With the idea
  of transiting the candidate points towards more promising positions, we propose
  a new method based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo to efficiently sample from an approximated
  posterior. We provide theoretical guarantees of its convergence in the Gaussian
  process Thompson sampling setting. We also show experimentally that both the Metropolis-Hastings
  and the Langevin Dynamics version of our algorithm outperform state-of-the-art methods
  in high-dimensional sequential optimization and reinforcement learning benchmarks.
