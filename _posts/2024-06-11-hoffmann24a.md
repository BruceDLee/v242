  Control'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 6th Annual Learning for Dynamics \& Control Conference
abstract: Model predictive control (MPC) is a powerful, optimization-based approach
  for controlling dynamical systems. However, the computational complexity of online
  optimization can be problematic on embedded devices. Especially, when we need to
  guarantee fixed control frequencies. Thus, previous work proposed to reduce the
  computational burden using imitation learning (IL) approximating the MPC policy
  by a neural network. In this work, we instead learn the whole planned trajectory
  of the MPC. We introduce a combination of a novel neural network architecture PlanNetX
  and a simple loss function based on the state trajectory that leverages the parameterized
  optimal control structure of the MPC. We validate our approach in the context of
  autonomous driving by learning a longitudinal planner and benchmarking it extensively
  in the CommonRoad simulator using synthetic scenarios and scenarios derived from
  real data. Our experimental results show that we can learn the open-loop MPC trajectory
  with high accuracy while improving the closed-loop performance of the learned control
  policy over other baselines like behavior cloning.
