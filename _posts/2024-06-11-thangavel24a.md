title: Design of observer-based finite-time control for inductively coupled power
  transfer system with random gain fluctuations
abstract: This investigation focuses on the issues of finite-time stochastic stabilisation
  and non fragile control design for inductively coupled power transfer systems (ICPTSs)
  in the presence of stochastic disturbances. Primarily, the observer system exploits
  the information obtained from the output of the ICPTSs to accurately reconstruct
  the states of the ICPTS. The observer-based non fragile control is put forward by
  including the estimated states of the system and gain fluctuations, which assist
  in achieving the desired finite-time stochastic stabilisation of the addressed system.
  Furthermore, via the use of Lyapunov stability theory and Itoâ€™s formula, conditions
  based on linear matrix inequalities are derived, which serve as adequate criteria
  for affirming the desired results. In conclusion, the results of the simulation
  that have been offered provide evidence that the proposed theoretical outcomes and
  control system are viable propositions.
