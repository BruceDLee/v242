title: Neural operators for boundary stabilization of stop-and-go traffic
abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach to PDE boundary control design using
  neural operators to alleviate stop-and-go traffic instabilities. Our framework leverages
  neural operators to design control strategies for traffic flow systems. The traffic
  dynamics are described by the Aw-Rascle- Zhang (ARZ) model, which consists of second-order
  coupled hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs). The backstepping method
  which involves constructing and solving a backstepping control kernel is widely
  used for boundary control of such PDE systems, but it requires intensive depth of
  expertise and can be time-consuming. To overcome these challenges, we present two
  distinct neural operator (NO) learning schemes aimed at stabilizing the traffic
  PDE system. The first scheme embeds NO-approximated gain kernels within a predefined
  backstepping controller, while the second one directly learns a boundary control
  law. The Lyapunov analysis is conducted to evaluate the stability of the NO-approximated
  gain kernels and control law. It is proved that the NO-based closed-loop system
  is practical stable under certain approximation accuracy conditions. To validate
  the efficacy of the proposed approach, simulations are conducted to compare the
  performance of the two neural operator controllers with a PDE backstepping controller
  and a Proportional Integral (PI) controller. While the NO-approximated methods exhibit
  larger errors compared to the backstepping controller, they consistently outperform
  the PI controller, demonstrating faster computation speeds across all scenarios.
  This result suggests that neural operators can significantly expedite and simplify
  the process of obtaining boundary controllers for freeway traffic stabilization
  systems.
