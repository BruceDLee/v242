title: Uncertainty quantification and robustification of model-based controllers using
  conformal prediction
abstract: In modern model-based control frameworks such as model predictive control
  or model-based reinforcement learning, machine learning has become a ubiquitous
  class of techniques deployed to improve the accuracy of the dynamics models. By
  leveraging expressive architectures such as neural networks, these frameworks aim
  to improve both the model accuracy and the control performance of the system, through
  the construction of accurate data-driven representations of the system dynamics.
  Despite achieving significant performance improvements over their non-learning counterparts,
  there are often little or no guarantees on how these model-based controllers with
  learned models would perform in the presence of uncertainty. In particular, under
  the influence of modeling errors, noise and exogenous disturbances, it is challenging
  to ascertain the accuracy of these learned models. In some cases, constraints may
  even be violated, rendering the controllers unsafe. In this work, we propose a novel
  framework that can be applied to a large class of model-based controllers and alleviates
  the above mentioned issues by robustifying the model-based controllers in an online
  and modular manner, with provable guarantees on the model accuracy and constraint
  satisfaction. The framework first deploys conformal prediction to generate finite-sample,
  provably valid uncertainty regions for the dynamics model in a distribution-free
  manner. These uncertainty regions are incorporated into the constraints through
  a dynamic constraint tightening procedure. Together with the formulation of a predictive
  reference generator, a set of robustified reference trajectories are generated and
  incorporated into the model-based controller. Using two practical case studies,
  we demonstrate that our proposed methodology not only produces well-calibrated uncertainty
  regions that establish the accuracy of the models, but also enables the closed-loop
  system to satisfy constraints in a robust yet non-conservative manner.
