title: Learning “Look-Ahead” Nonlocal Traffic Dynamics in a Ring Road
booktitle: Proceedings of the 6th Annual Learning for Dynamics \& Control Conference
abstract: 'The macroscopic traffic flow model is widely used for traffic control and
  management. To incorporate drivers’ anticipative behaviors and to remove impractical
  speed discontinuity inherent in the classic Lighthill–Whitham–Richards (LWR) traffic
  model, nonlocal partial differential equation (PDE) models with “look-ahead” dynamics
  have been proposed, which assume that the speed is a function of weighted downstream
  traffic density. However, it lacks data validation on two important questions: whether
  there exist nonlocal dynamics, and how the length and weight of the “look-ahead”
  window affect the spatial temporal propagation of traffic densities. In this paper,
  we adopt traffic trajectory data from a ring-road experiment and design a physics-informed
  neural network to learn the fundamental diagram and look-ahead kernel that best
  fit the data, and reinvent a data-enhanced nonlocal LWR model via minimizing the
  loss function combining the data discrepancy and the nonlocal model discrepancy.
  Results show that the learned nonlocal LWR yields a more accurate prediction of
  traffic wave propagation in three different scenarios: stop-and-go oscillations,
  congested, and free traffic. We first demonstrate the existence of “look-ahead”
  effect with real traffic data. The optimal nonlocal kernel is found out to take
  a length of around 35 to 50 meters, and the kernel weight within 5 meters accounts
  for the majority of the nonlocal effect. Our results also underscore the importance
  of choosing a priori physics in machine learning models.'
