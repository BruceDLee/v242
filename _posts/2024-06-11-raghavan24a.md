title: A multi-modal distributed learning algorithm in reproducing kernel Hilbert
  spaces
abstract: We consider the problem of function estimation by a multi-agent system consisting
  of two agents and a fusion center. Each agent receives data comprising of samples
  of an independent variable (input) and the corresponding values of the dependent
  variable (output). The data remains local and is not shared with other members in
  the system. The objective of the system is to collaboratively estimate the function
  from the input to the output. To this end, we present an iterative distributed algorithm
  for this function estimation problem. Each agent solves a local estimation problem
  in a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) and uploads the function to the fusion
  center. At the fusion center, the functions are fused by first estimating the data
  points that would have generated the uploaded functions and then subsequently solving
  a least squares estimation problem using the estimated data from both functions.
  The fused function is downloaded by the agents and is subsequently used for estimation
  at the next iteration along with incoming data. This procedure is executed sequentially
  and stopped when the difference between consecutively estimated functions becomes
  small enough. With respect to the algorithm, we prove existence of basis functions
  for suitable representation of estimated functions and present closed form solutions
  to the estimation problems at the agents and the fusion center.
