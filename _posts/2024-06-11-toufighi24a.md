title: Decision boundary learning for safe vision-based navigation via Hamilton-Jacobi
  reachability analysis and support vector machine
abstract: We develop a self-supervised learning method that can predict safe and unsafe
  high-level waypoints for robot navigation in the form of a decision boundary given
  solely a RGB image without knowledge of a prior map. To provide the theoretical
  basis for such prediction, we use a Hamilton-Jacobi reachability analysis, a formal
  verification method, as the oracle for labeling training datasets. Given the labeled
  data, our neural network learn the coefficients of a decision boundary via a soft-margin
  Support Vector Machine loss function to classify safe and unsafe system states.
  We experimentally show that our method is generalizable and generates safety decision
  boundaries in unseen indoor environments. Our method advantages are its explainability
  and accurate safety prediction, which is important for safety-critical systems.
  Finally, we demonstrate our method via experiments where we showcase the learning-based
  safe decision boundary estimation that employs monocular RGB images, and current
  linear speed.
