title: Adaptive neural network based control approach for building energy control
  under changing environmental conditions
abstract: Deep neural networks are adept at modeling complex relationships between
  input and output variables. When trained on diverse datasets, they can understand
  not just the specifics of individual objects but also the broader principles governing
  an entire object class. This research applies this principle to building heating
  control, a domain marked by significant heterogeneity and constant environmental
  changes, including renovations and changes in user behavior. Our approach involves
  training the network on a wide range of data instances, enhancing its adaptability
  to newly distributed data representing unseen scenarios. We find that Transformer-based
  LSTM architectures are particularly adept for this task as they are able to remember
  previous tasks’ learning. We propose a simple yet effective control algorithm that
  separates system identification and forecasting from the optimization-based control
  step. This separation simplifies the control process while ensuring robust performance.
  In a wide range of simulation experiments, we demonstrate that our “universally
  trained” neural network control can adjust to changing conditions, thus reducing
  the need for more complex continual learning techniques. Our results suggest that
  training neural networks on varied datasets empowers the network with the ability
  to generalize and adapt beyond specific training instances, which demonstrates their
  effectiveness in dynamic and heterogeneous environments.
