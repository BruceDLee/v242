  Koopman Modelling'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 6th Annual Learning for Dynamics \& Control Conference
abstract: We introduce the use of harmonic analysis to decompose the state space of
  symmetric robotic systems into orthogonal isotypic subspaces. These are lower-dimensional
  spaces that capture distinct, symmetric, and synergistic motions. For linear dynamics,
  we characterize how this decomposition leads to a subdivision of the dynamics into
  independent linear systems on each subspace, a property we term dynamics harmonic
  analysis (DHA). To exploit this property, we use Koopman operator theory to propose
  an equivariant deep-learning architecture that leverages the properties of DHA to
  learn a global linear model of the system dynamics. Our architecture, validated
  on synthetic systems and the dynamics of locomotion of a quadrupedal robot, exhibits
  enhanced generalization, sample efficiency, and interpretability, with less trainable
  parameters and computational costs.
