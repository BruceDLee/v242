title: Conditions for parameter unidentifiability of linear ARX systems for enhancing
  security
abstract: For an adversarial observer of parametric systems, the identifiability of
  parameters reflects the possibility of inferring the system dynamics and then affects
  the performance of attacks against the systems. Hence, achieving unidentifiability
  of the parameters, which makes the adversary unable to get identification with low
  variance, is an attractive way to enhance security. In this paper, we propose a
  quantitative definition to measure the unidentifiability based on the lower bound
  of identification variance. The lower bound is given via the analysis of the Fisher
  Information Matrix (FIM). Then, we propose the necessary and sufficient condition
  for unidentifiability and derive the explicit form of the unidentifiability condition
  for linear autoregressive systems with exogenous inputs (ARX systems). It is proved
  that the unidentifiability of linear ARX systems can be achieved through quadratic
  constraints on inputs and outputs. Finally, considering an optimal control problem
  with security concerns, we apply the unidentifiability constraint and obtain the
  optimal controller. Simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.
