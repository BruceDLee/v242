title: 'Learning for CasADi: Data-driven Models in Numerical Optimization'
abstract: 'While real-world problems are often challenging to analyze analytically,
  deep learning excels in modeling complex processes from data. Existing optimization
  frameworks like CasADi facilitate seamless usage of solvers but face challenges
  when integrating learned process models into numerical optimizations. To address
  this gap, we present the Learning for CasADi (L4CasADi) framework, enabling the
  seamless integration of PyTorch-learned models with CasADi for efficient and potentially
  hardware-accelerated numerical optimization. The applicability of L4CasADi is demonstrated
  with two tutorial examples: First, we optimize a fishâ€™s trajectory in a turbulent
  river for energy efficiency where the turbulent flow is represented by a PyTorch
  model. Second, we demonstrate how an implicit Neural Radiance Field environment
  representation can be easily leveraged for optimal control with L4CasADi. L4CasADi,
  along with examples and documentation, is available under MIT license at https://github.com/Tim-Salzmann/l4casadi'
