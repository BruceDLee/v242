title: Learning and Deploying Robust Locomotion Policies with Minimal Dynamics Randomization
booktitle: Proceedings of the 6th Annual Learning for Dynamics \& Control Conference
abstract: Training Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) locomotion policies often require
  massive amounts of data to converge to the desired behavior. In this regard, simulators
  provide a cheap and abundant source. For successful sim-to-real transfer, xhaustively
  engineered approaches such as system identification, dynamics randomization, and
  domain adaptation are generally employed. As an alternative, we investigate a simple
  strategy of random force injection (RFI) to perturb system dynamics during training.
  We show that the application of random forces enables us to emulate dynamics randomization.
  This allows us to obtain locomotion policies that are robust to variations in system
  dynamics. We further extend RFI, referred to as extended random force injection
  (ERFI), by introducing an episodic actuation offset. We demonstrate that ERFI provides
  additional robustness for variations in system mass offering on average a 53% improved
  performance over RFI. We also show that ERFI is sufficient to perform a successful
  sim-to-real transfer on two different quadrupedal platforms, ANYmal C and Unitree
  A1, even for perceptive locomotion over uneven terrain in outdoor environments.
