title: 'Tracking Object Positions in Reinforcement Learning: A Metric for Keypoint
  Detection'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 6th Annual Learning for Dynamics \& Control Conference
abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) for robot control typically requires a detailed
  representation of the environment state, including information about task-relevant
  objects not directly measurable. Keypoint detectors, such as spatial autoencoders
  (SAEs), are a common approach to extracting a low-dimensional representation from
  high-dimensional image data. SAEs aim at spatial features such as object positions,
  which are often useful representations in robotic RL. However, whether an SAE is
  actually able to track objects in the scene and thus yields a spatial state representation
  well suited for RL tasks has rarely been examined due to a lack of established metrics.
  In this paper, we propose to assess the performance of an SAE instance by measuring
  how well keypoints track ground truth objects in images. We present a computationally
  lightweight metric and use it to evaluate common baseline SAE architectures on image
  data from a simulated robot task. We find that common SAEs differ substantially
  in their spatial extraction capability. Furthermore, we validate that SAEs that
  perform well in our metric achieve superior performance when used in downstream
  RL. Thus, our metric is an effective and lightweight indicator of RL performance
  before executing expensive RL training. Building on these insights, we identify
  three key modifications of SAE architectures to improve tracking performance. We
  make our code available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/sae-rl.
