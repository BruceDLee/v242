  of Physical Priors in Model-Predictive Control'

abstract: Model-based RL/control have gained significant traction in robotics. Yet,
  these approaches often remain data-inefficient and lack the explainability of hand-engineered
  solutions. This makes them difficult to debug/integrate in safety-critical settings.
  However, in many systems, prior knowledge of environment kinematics/dynamics is
  available. Incorporating such priors can help address the aforementioned problems
  by reducing problem complexity and the need for exploration, while also facilitating
  the expression of the decisions taken by the agent in terms of physically meaningful
  entities. Our aim with this paper is to illustrate and support this point of view
  via a case-study. We model a payload manipulation problem based on a real robotic
  system, and show that leveraging prior knowledge about the dynamics of the environment
  in an MPC framework can lead to improvements in explainability, safety and data-efficiency,
  leading to satisfying generalization properties with less data.
