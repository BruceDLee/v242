title: A framework for evaluating human driver models using neuroimaging
booktitle: Proceedings of the 6th Annual Learning for Dynamics \& Control Conference
abstract: Driving is a complex task which requires synthesizing multiple senses, safely
  reasoning about the behavior of others, and adapting to a constantly changing environment.
  Failures of human driving models can become failures of vehicle safety features
  or autonomous driving systems that rely on their predictions. Although there has
  been a variety of work to model human drivers, it can be challenging to determine
  to what extent they truly resemble the humans they attempt to mimic. The development
  of improved human driver models can serve as a step towards better vehicle safety.
  In order to better compare and develop driver models, we propose going beyond driving
  behavior to examine how well these models reflect the cognitive activity of human
  drivers. In particular, we compare features extracted from human driver models with
  brain activity as measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging. We demonstrate
  this approach on three human driver models with brain activity data from two human
  subjects. We find that model predictive control is a better fit for driver brain
  activity than classic non-predictive models, which is in good agreement with previous
  works that obtain better predictions of human driving behavior using model predictive
  control.
