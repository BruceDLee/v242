title: Recursively Feasible Shrinking-Horizon MPC in Dynamic Environments with Conformal
  Prediction Guarantees
booktitle: Proceedings of the 6th Annual Learning for Dynamics \& Control Conference
abstract: In this paper, we focus on the problem of shrinking-horizon Model Predictive
  Control (MPC) in uncertain dynamic environments. We consider controlling a deterministic
  autonomous system that interacts with uncontrollable stochastic agents during its
  mission. Employing tools from conformal prediction, existing works derive high-confidence
  prediction regions for the unknown agent trajectories, and integrate these regions
  in the design of suitable safety constraints for MPC. Despite guaranteeing probabilistic
  safety of the closed-loop trajectories, these constraints do not ensure feasibility
  of the respective MPC schemes for the entire duration of the mission. We propose
  a shrinking-horizon MPC that guarantees recursive feasibility via a gradual relaxation
  of the safety constraints as new prediction regions become available online. This
  relaxation enforces the safety constraints to hold over the least restrictive prediction
  region from the set of all available prediction regions. In a comparative case study
  with the state of the art, we empirically show that our approach results in tighter
  prediction regions and verify recursive feasibility of our MPC scheme.
