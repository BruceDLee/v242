  Retraining'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 6th Annual Learning for Dynamics \& Control Conference
abstract: Model Predictive Control (MPC) is a method to control nonlinear systems
  with guaranteed stability and constraint satisfaction but suffers from high computation
  times. Approximate MPC (AMPC) with neural networks (NNs) has emerged to address
  this limitation, enabling deployment on resource-constrained embedded systems. However,
  when tuning AMPCs for real-world systems, large datasets need to be regenerated
  and the NN needs to be retrained at every tuning step. This work introduces a novel,
  parameter-adaptive AMPC architecture capable of online tuning without recomputing
  large datasets and retraining. By incorporating local sensitivities of nonlinear
  programs, the proposed method not only mimics optimal MPC inputs but also adjusts
  to known changes in physical parameters of the model using linear predictions while
  still guaranteeing stability. We showcase the effectiveness of parameter-adaptive
  AMPC by controlling the swing-ups of two different real cartpole systems with a
  severely resource-constrained microcontroller (MCU). We use the same NN across both
  system instances that have different parameters. This work not only represents the
  first experimental demonstration of AMPC for fast-moving systems on low-cost MCUs
  to the best of our knowledge, but also showcases generalization across system instances
  and variations through our parameter-adaptation method. Taken together, these contributions
  represent a marked step toward the practical application of AMPC in real-world systems.
