title: Gradient shaping for multi-constraint safe reinforcement learning
abstract: Online safe reinforcement learning (RL) involves training a policy that
  maximizes task efficiency while satisfying constraints via interacting with the
  environments. In this paper, our focus lies in addressing the complex challenges
  associated with solving multi-constraint (MC) safe RL problems. We approach the
  Safe RL problem from the perspective of Multi-Objective Optimization (MOO) and propose
  a unified framework designed for MC safe RL algorithms. This framework highlights
  the manipulation of gradients derived from constraints. Leveraging insights from
  this framework and recognizing the significance of redundant and conflicting constraint
  conditions, we introduce the Gradient Shaping (GradS) method for general Lagrangian-based
  safe RL algorithms to improve the training efficiency in terms of both reward and
  constraint satisfaction. Our extensive experimentation demonstrates the effectiveness
  of our proposed method in encouraging exploration and learning a policy that improves
  both safety and reward performance across various challenging MC safe RL tasks as
  well as good scalability to the constraint dimension.
