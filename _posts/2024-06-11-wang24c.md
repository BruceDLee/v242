title: 'Towards bio-inspired control of aerial vehicle: Distributed aerodynamic parameters
  for state prediction'
abstract: In an era where traditional flight control systems are increasingly strained
  by the demands of modern aerial missions, this research introduces a novel integration
  of bio-inspired sensing mechanisms into aerial vehicle control systems, aimed at
  revolutionizing the adaptability and efficiency of UAV operations. Current gust
  suppression technologies often activate only after disturbances have occurred, highlighting
  significant limitations in real-time responsiveness and computational efficiency.
  With a specific emphasis on employing distributed aerodynamic parameters for predicting
  flight states, the study utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a Long
  Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to investigate the predictive capabilities of these
  models under varying conditions, including scenarios with full and limited input
  data. The models were assessed on their ability to forecast the pitch rate of Unmanned
  Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), examining both the precision of predictions in response
  to different historical input sizes and their robustness against simulated sensor
  noise. Results highlight the potential of using aerodynamic data to enhance the
  reliability and adaptability of flight control systems, significantly reducing dependency
  on specific sensor inputs. This approach not only demonstrates the effectiveness
  of integrating sophisticated machine learning models with aerospace technology but
  also paves the way for more adaptive, efficient control systems in UAV operations.
