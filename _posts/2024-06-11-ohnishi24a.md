abstract: Path signatures have been proposed as a powerful representation of paths
  that efficiently captures the pathâ€™s analytic and geometric characteristics, having
  useful algebraic properties including fast concatenation of paths through tensor
  products. Signatures have recently been widely adopted in machine learning problems
  for time series analysis. In this work we establish connections between value functions
  typically used in optimal control and intriguing properties of path signatures.
  These connections motivate our novel control framework with signature transforms
  that efficiently generalizes the Bellman equation to the space of trajectories.
  We analyze the properties and advantages of the framework, termed signature control.
  In particular, we demonstrate that (i) it can naturally deal with varying/adaptive
  time steps; (ii) it propagates higher-level information more efficiently than value
  function updates; (iii) it is robust to dynamical system misspecification over long
  rollouts. As a specific case of our framework, we devise a model predictive control
  method for path tracking. This method generalizes integral control, being suitable
  for problems with unknown disturbances. The proposed algorithms are tested in simulation,
  with differentiable physics models including typical control and robotics tasks
  such as point-mass, curve following for an ant model, and a robotic manipulator.
