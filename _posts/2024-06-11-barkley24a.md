title: An Investigation of Time Reversal Symmetry in Reinforcement Learning
booktitle: Proceedings of the 6th Annual Learning for Dynamics \& Control Conference
abstract: One of the fundamental challenges associated with reinforcement learning
  (RL) is that collecting sufficient data can be both time-consuming and expensive.
  In this paper, we formalize a concept of time reversal symmetry in a Markov decision
  process (MDP), which builds upon the established structure of dynamically reversible
  Markov chains (DRMCs) and time-reversibility in classical physics. Specifically,
  we investigate the utility of this concept in reducing the sample complexity of
  reinforcement learning. We observe that utilizing the structure of time reversal
  in an MDP allows every environment transition experienced by an agent to be transformed
  into a feasible reverse-time transition, effectively doubling the number of experiences
  in the environment. To test the usefulness of this newly synthesized data, we develop
  a novel approach called time symmetric data augmentation (TSDA) and investigate
  its application in both proprioceptive and pixel-based state within the realm of
  off-policy, model-free RL. Empirical evaluations showcase how these synthetic transitions
  can enhance the sample efficiency of RL agents in time reversible scenarios without
  friction or contact. We also test this method in more realistic environments where
  these assumptions are not globally satisfied. We find that TSDA can significantly
  degrade sample efficiency and policy performance, but can also improve sample efficiency
  under the right conditions. Ultimately we conclude that time symmetry shows promise
  in enhancing the sample efficiency of reinforcement learning and provide guidance
  when the environment and reward structures are of an appropriate form for TSDA to
  be employed effectively.
