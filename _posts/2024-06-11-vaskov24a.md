title: 'Do no harm: A counterfactual approach to safe reinforcement learning'
abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) for control has become increasingly popular
  due to its ability to learn feedback policies that can take into account complex
  representations of the environment and uncertainty. When considering safety constraints,
  constrained optimization approaches where agents are penalized for constraint violations
  are commonly used. In such methods, if agents are initialized in or must visit states
  where constraint violation might be inevitable, it is unclear if or how much they
  should be penalized. We address this challenge by formulating a constraint on the
  counterfactual harm of the learned policy compared to an alternate, safe policy.
  In a philosophical sense this method only penalizes the learner for constraint violations
  that it caused; in a practical sense it maintains feasibility of the optimal control
  problem when constraint violation is inevitable. We present simulation studies on
  a rover with uncertain road friction and a tractor-trailer parking environment that
  demonstrate our constraint formulation enables agents to learn safer policies than
  traditional constrained RL methods.
