title: Lagrangian Inspired Polynomial Estimator for black-box learning and control
  of underactuated systems
booktitle: Proceedings of the 6th Annual Learning for Dynamics \& Control Conference
abstract: The Lagrangian Inspired Polynomial (LIP) estimator (Giacomuzzo et al., 2023)
  is a black-box estimator based on Gaussian Process Regression, recently presented
  for the inverse dynamics identi- fication of Lagrangian systems. It relies on a
  novel multi-output kernel that embeds the structure of the Euler-Lagrange equation.
  In this work, we extend its analysis to the class of underactuated robots. First,
  we show that, despite being a black-box model, the LIP allows estimating kinetic
  and potential energies, as well as the inertial, Coriolis, and gravity components
  directly from the overall torque measures. Then we exploit these properties to derive
  a two-stage energy-based controller for the swing-up and stabilization of balancing
  robots. Experimental results on a simulated Pendubot confirm the feasibility of
  the proposed approach.
