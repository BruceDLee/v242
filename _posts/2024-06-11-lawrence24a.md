title: Deep Hankel matrices with random elements
booktitle: Proceedings of the 6th Annual Learning for Dynamics \& Control Conference
abstract: 'Willemsâ€™ fundamental lemma enables a trajectory-based characterization
  of linear systems through data-based Hankel matrices. However, in the presence of
  measurement noise, we ask: Is this noisy Hankel-based model expressive enough to
  re-identify itself? In other words, we study the output prediction accuracy from
  recursively applying the same persistently exciting input sequence to the model.
  We find an asymptotic connection to this self-consistency question in terms of the
  amount of data. More importantly, we also connect this question to the depth (number
  of rows) of the Hankel model, showing the simple act of reconfiguring a finite dataset
  significantly improves accuracy. We apply these insights to find a parsimonious
  depth for LQR problems over the trajectory space.'
