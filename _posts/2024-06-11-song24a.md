title: Stable Modular Control via Contraction Theory for Reinforcement Learning
abstract: 'We propose a novel way to integrate control theoretical results with reinforcement
  learning (RL) for stability, robustness, and generalization: developing modular
  control architectures via contraction theory to simplify the complex problems. To
  guarantee control stability for RL, we leverage modularity to deconstruct the nonlinear
  stability problems into algebraically solvable ones, yielding linear constraints
  on the input gradients of control networks that can be as simple as switching the
  signs of network weights. This control architecture can be implemented in general
  RL frameworks without modifying the algorithms. This minimally invasive way allows
  arguably easy integration into hierarchical RL, and improves its performance. We
  realize the modularity by constructing an auxiliary space through coordinate transformation.
  Within the auxiliary space, system dynamics can be represented as hierarchical combinations
  of subsystems. These subsystems converge recursively following their hierarchies,
  provided stable self-feedbacks. We implement this modular control architecture in
  PPO and hierarchical RL, and demonstrate in simulation (i) the necessity of control
  stability for robustness and generalization and (ii) the effectiveness in improving
  hierarchical RL for manipulation learning.'
