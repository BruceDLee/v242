title: Data Driven Verification of Positive Invariant Sets for Discrete, Nonlinear
  Systems
booktitle: Proceedings of the 6th Annual Learning for Dynamics \& Control Conference
abstract: Invariant sets are essential for understanding the stability and safety
  of nonlinear systems. However, certifying the existence of a positive invariant
  set for a nonlinear model is difficult and often requires knowledge of the system’s
  dynamic model. This paper presents a data driven method to certify a positive invariant
  set for an unknown, discrete, nonlinear system. A triangulation of a subset of the
  state space is used to query data points. Then, linear programming is used to create
  a continuous piecewise affine function that fulfills the criteria of the Extended
  Invariant Set Principle by leveraging an inequality error bound that uses the Lipschitz
  constant of the unknown system. Numerical results demonstrate the program’s ability
  to certify positive invariant sets from sampled data.
