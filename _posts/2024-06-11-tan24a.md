title: Physics-Constrained Learning for PDE Systems with Uncertainty Quantified Port-Hamiltonian
  Models
abstract: Modeling the dynamics of flexible objects has become an emerging topic in
  the community as these objects become more present in many applications, e.g., soft
  robotics. Due to the properties of flexible materials, the movements of soft objects
  are often highly nonlinear and, thus, complex to predict. Data-driven approaches
  seem promising for modeling those complex dynamics but often neglect basic physical
  principles, which consequently makes them untrustworthy and limits generalization.
  To address this problem, we propose a physics-constrained learning method that combines
  powerful learning tools and reliable physical models. Our method leverages the data
  collected from observations by sending them into a Gaussian process that is physically
  constrained by a distributed Port-Hamiltonian model. Based on the Bayesian nature
  of the Gaussian process, we not only learn the dynamics of the system, but also
  enable uncertainty quantification. Furthermore, the proposed approach preserves
  the compositional nature of Port-Hamiltonian systems.
