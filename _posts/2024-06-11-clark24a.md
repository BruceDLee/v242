title: 'Adaptive Teaching in Heterogeneous Agents: Balancing Surprise in Sparse Reward
  Scenarios'
abstract: Learning from Demonstration (LfD) can be an efficient way to train systems
  with analogous agents by enabling “Student” agents to learn from the demonstrations
  of the most experienced “Teacher” agent, instead of training their policy in parallel.
  However, when there are discrepancies in agent capabilities, such as divergent actuator
  power or joint angle constraints, naively replicating demonstrations that are out
  of bounds for the Student’s capability can limit efficient learning. We present
  a Teacher-Student learning framework specifically tailored to address the challenge
  of heterogeneity between the Teacher and Student agents. Our framework is based
  on the concept of “surprise”, inspired by its application in exploration incentivization
  in sparse-reward environments. Surprise is repurposed to enable the Teacher to detect
  and adapt to differences between itself and the Student. By focusing on maximizing
  its surprise in response to the environment while concurrently minimizing the Student’s
  surprise in response to the demonstrations, the Teacher agent can effectively tailor
  its demonstrations to the Student’s specific capabilities and constraints. We validate
  our method by demonstrating improvements in the Student’s learning in control tasks
  within sparse-reward environments.
