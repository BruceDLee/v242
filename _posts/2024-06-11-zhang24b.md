  Learning Algorithms'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 6th Annual Learning for Dynamics \& Control Conference
abstract: 'We introduce controlgym, a library of thirty-six industrial control settings,
  and ten infinite-dimensional partial differential equation (PDE)-based control problems.
  Integrated within the OpenAI Gym/Gymnasium (Gym) framework, controlgym allows direct
  applications of standard reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms like stable-baselines3.
  Our control environments complement those in Gym with continuous, unbounded action
  and observation spaces, motivated by real-world control applications. Moreover,
  the PDE control environments uniquely allow the users to extend the state dimensionality
  of the system to infinity while preserving the intrinsic dynamics. This feature
  is crucial for evaluating the scalability of RL algorithms for control. This project
  serves the learning for dynamics & control (L4DC) community, aiming to explore key
  questions: the convergence of RL algorithms in learning control policies; the stability
  and robustness issues of learning-based controllers; and the scalability of RL algorithms
  to high- and potentially infinite-dimensional systems. We open-source the controlgym
  project at https://github.com/xiangyuan-zhang/controlgym.'
