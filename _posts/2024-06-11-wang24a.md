title: Adapting Image-based RL Policies via Predicted Rewards
abstract: 'Image-based reinforcement learning (RL) faces significant challenges in
  generalization when the visual environment undergoes substantial changes between
  training and deployment. Under such circumstances, learned policies may not perform
  well leading to degraded results. Previous approaches to this problem have largely
  focused on broadening the training observation distribution, employing techniques
  like data augmentation and domain randomization. However, given the sequential nature
  of the RL decision-making problem, it is often the case that residual errors are
  propagated by the learned policy model and accumulate throughout the trajectory,
  resulting in highly degraded performance. In this paper, we leverage the observation
  that predicted rewards under domain shift, even though imperfect, can still be a
  useful signal to guide fine-tuning. We exploit this property to fine-tune a policy
  using reward prediction in the target domain. We have found that, even under significant
  domain shift, the predicted reward can still provide meaningful signal and fine-tuning
  substantially improves the original policy. Our approach, termed Predicted Reward
  Fine-tuning (PRFT), improves performance across diverse tasks in both simulated
  benchmarks and real-world experiments. More information is available at project
