title: Online decision making with history-average dependent costs
abstract: In many online sequential decision-making scenarios, a learnerâ€™s choices
  affect not just their current costs but also the future ones. In this work, we look
  at one particular case of such a situation where the costs depend on the time average
  of past decisions over a history horizon. We first recast this problem with history
  dependent costs as a problem of decision making under stage-wise constraints. To
  tackle this, we then propose the novel Follow-The-Adaptively-Regularized-Leader
  (FTARL) algorithm. Our innovative algorithm incorporates adaptive regularizers that
  depend explicitly on past decisions, allowing us to enforce stage-wise constraints
  while simultaneously enabling us to establish tight regret bounds. We also discuss
  the implications of the length of history horizon on design of no-regret algorithms
  for our problem and present impossibility results when it is the full learning horizon.
