title: Adaptive Online Non-stochastic Control
booktitle: Proceedings of the 6th Annual Learning for Dynamics \& Control Conference
abstract: We tackle the problem of Non-stochastic Control (NSC) with the aim of obtaining
  algorithms whose policy regret is proportional to the difficulty of the controlled
  environment. Namely, we tailor the Follow The Regularized Leader (FTRL) framework
  to dynamical systems by using regularizers that are proportional to the actual witnessed
  costs. The main challenge arises from using the proposed adaptive regularizers in
  the presence of a state, or equivalently, a memory, which couples the effect of
  the online decisions and requires new tools for bounding the regret. Via new analysis
  techniques for NSC and FTRL integration, we obtain novel disturbance action controllers
  (DAC) with sub-linear data adaptive policy regret bounds that shrink when the trajectory
  of costs has small gradients, while staying sub-linear even in the worst case.
