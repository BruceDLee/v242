title: Data-driven simulator for mechanical circulatory support with domain adversarial
  neural process
abstract: We propose a data-driven simulator for Mechanical Circulatory Support (MCS)
  devices, implemented as a probabilistic deep sequence model. Existing mechanical
  simulators for MCS rely on oversimplifying assumptions and are insensitive to patient-specific
  behavior, limiting their applicability to real-world treatment scenarios. To address
  these shortcomings, our model Domain Adversarial Neural Process (DANP) employs a
  neural process architecture, allowing it to capture the probabilistic relationship
  between MCS pump levels and aortic pressure measurements with uncertainty. We use
  domain adversarial training to combine real-world and simulation data, resulting
  in a more realistic and diverse representation of potential outcomes. Empirical
  results with an improvement of 19% in non-stationary trend prediction establish
  DANP as an effective tool for clinicians to understand and make informed decisions
  regarding MCS patient treatment.
