title: Expert with clustering: Hierarchical online preference learning framework
abstract: 'Emerging mobility systems are increasingly capable of recommending options
  to mobility users, to guide them towards personalized yet sustainable system outcomes.
  Even more so than the typical recommendation system, it is crucial to minimize regret,
  because 1) the mobility options directly affect the lives of the users, and 2) the
  system sustainability relies on sufficient user participation. In this study, we
  thus consider accelerating user preference learning by exploiting a low-dimensional
  latent space that captures the mobility preferences of users within a population.
  We therefore introduce a hierarchical contextual bandit framework named Expert with
  Clustering (EWC), which integrates clustering techniques and prediction with expert
  advice. EWC efficiently utilizes hierarchical user information and incorporates
  a novel Loss-guided Distance metric. This metric is instrumental in generating more
  representative cluster centroids, thereby enhancing the performance of recommendation
  systems. In a recommendation scenario with \(N\){users}, \(T\){rounds} per user,
  and \(K\){options}, our algorithm achieves a regret bound of \(O(N\sqrt{T\log K}
  + NT)\). This bound consists of two parts: the first term is the regret from the
  Hedge algorithm, and the second term depends on the average loss from clustering.
  The algorithm performs with low regret, especially when a latent hierarchical structure
  exists among users. This regret bound underscores the theoretical and experimental
  efficacy of EWC, particularly in scenarios that demand rapid learning and adaptation.
  Experimental results highlight that EWC can substantially reduce regret by 27.57%
  compared to the LinUCB baseline. Our work offers a data-efficient approach to capturing
  both individual and collective behaviors, making it highly applicable to contexts
  with hierarchical structures. We expect the algorithm to be applicable to other
  settings with layered nuances of user preferences and information.'
