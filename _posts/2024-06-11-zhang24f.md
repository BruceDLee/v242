title: Pontryagin Neural Operator for Solving General-Sum Differential Games with
  Parametric State Constraints
booktitle: Proceedings of the 6th Annual Learning for Dynamics \& Control Conference
abstract: The values of two-player general-sum differential games are viscosity solutions
  to Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs (HJI) equations. Value and policy approximations for such
  games suffer from the curse of dimensionality (CoD). Alleviating CoD through physics-informed
  neural networks (PINN) encounters convergence issues when value discontinuity is
  present due to state constraints. On top of these challenges, it is often necessary
  to learn generalizable values and policies across a parametric space of games, e.g.,
  for game parameter inference when information is incomplete. To address these challenges,
  we propose in this paper a Pontryagin-mode neural operator that outperforms existing
  state-of-the-art (SOTA) on safety performance across games with parametric state
  constraints. Our key contribution is the introduction of a costate loss defined
  on the discrepancy between forward and backward costate rollouts, which are computationally
  cheap. We show that the discontinuity of costate dynamics (in the presence of state
  constraints) effectively enables the learning of discontinuous values, without requiring
  manually supervised data as suggested by the current SOTA. More importantly, we
  show that the close relationship between costates and policies makes the former
  critical in learning feedback control policies with generalizable safety performance.
