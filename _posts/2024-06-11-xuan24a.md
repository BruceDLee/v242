title: On the Uniqueness of Solution for the Bellman Equation of LTL Objectives
booktitle: Proceedings of the 6th Annual Learning for Dynamics \& Control Conference
abstract: Surrogate rewards for linear temporal logic (LTL) objectives are commonly
  utilized in planning problems for LTL objectives. In a widely-adopted surrogate
  reward approach, two discount factors are used to ensure that the expected return
  approximates the satisfaction probability of the LTL objective. The expected return
  then can be estimated by methods using the Bellman updates such as reinforcement
  learning. However, the uniqueness of the solution to the Bellman equation with two
  discount factors has not been explicitly discussed. We demonstrate with an example
  that when one of the discount factors is set to one, as allowed in many previous
  works, the Bellman equation may have multiple solutions, leading to inaccurate evaluation
  of the expected return. We then propose a condition for the Bellman equation to
  have the expected return as the unique solution, requiring the solutions for states
  inside a rejecting bottom strongly connected component (BSCC) to be $0$. We prove
  this condition is sufficient by showing that the solutions for the states with discounting
  can be separated from those for the states without discounting under this condition.
