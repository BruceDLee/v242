title: How Safe Am I Given What I See? Calibrated Prediction of Safety Chances for
  Image-Controlled Autonomy
booktitle: Proceedings of the 6th Annual Learning for Dynamics \& Control Conference
abstract: End-to-end learning has emerged as a major paradigm for developing autonomous
  controllers. Unfortunately, with its performance and convenience comes an even greater
  challenge of safety assurance. A key factor in this challenge is the absence of
  low-dimensional and interpretable dynamical states, around which traditional assurance
  methods revolve. Focusing on the online safety prediction problem, this paper systematically
  investigates a flexible family of learning pipelines based on generative world models,
  which do not require low-dimensional states. To implement these pipelines, we overcome
  the challenges of missing safety labels under prediction-induced distribution shift
  and learning safety-informed latent representations. Moreover, we provide statistical
  calibration guarantees for our safety chance predictions based on conformal inference.
  An extensive evaluation of our predictor family on two image-controlled case studies,
  a racing car and a cartpole, delivers counterintuitive results and highlights open
  problems in deep safety prediction.
