title: Convex Approximations for a Bi-level Formulation of Data-Enabled Predictive
  Control
booktitle: Proceedings of the 6th Annual Learning for Dynamics \& Control Conference
abstract: The Willemsâ€™ fundamental lemma, which characterizes linear time invariant
  (LTI) systems using input and output trajectories, has found many successful applications.
  Combining this with receding horizon control leads to a popular Data-EnablEd Predictive
  Control (DeePC) scheme. DeePC is first established for LTI systems and has been
  extended and applied for practical systems beyond LTI settings. However, the relationship
  between different DeePC variants, involving regularization and dimension reduction,
  remains unclear. In this paper, we first discuss a bi-level optimization formulation
  that combines a data pre-processing step as an inner problem (system identification)
  and predictive control as an outer problem (online control). We next introduce a
  series of convex approximations by relaxing some hard constraints in the bi-level
  optimization as suitable regularization terms, accounting for an implicit identification.
  These include some existing DeePC variants as well as two new variants, for which
  we establish their equivalence under appropriate settings. Notably, our analysis
  reveals a novel variant, called DeePC-SVD-Iter, which has remarkable empirical performance
  of direct methods on systems beyond deterministic LTI settings.
