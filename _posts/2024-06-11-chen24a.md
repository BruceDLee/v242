title: Leveraging Hamilton-Jacobi PDEs with time-dependent Hamiltonians for continual
  scientific machine learning
abstract: 'We address two major challenges in scientific machine learning (SciML):
  interpretability and computational efficiency. We increase the interpretability
  of certain learning processes by establishing a new theoretical connection between
  optimization problems arising from SciML and a generalized Hopf formula, which represents
  the viscosity solution to a Hamilton-Jacobi partial differential equation (HJ PDE)
  with time-dependent Hamiltonian. Namely, we show that when we solve certain regularized
  learning problems with integral-type losses, we actually solve an optimal control
  problem and its associated HJ PDE with time-dependent Hamiltonian. This connection
  allows us to reinterpret incremental updates to learned models as the evolution
  of an associated HJ PDE and optimal control problem in time, where all of the previous
  information is intrinsically encoded in the solution to the HJ PDE. As a result,
  existing HJ PDE solvers and optimal control algorithms can be reused to design new
  efficient training approaches for SciML that naturally coincide with the continual
  learning framework, while avoiding catastrophic forgetting. As a first exploration
  of this connection, we consider the special case of linear regression and leverage
  our connection to develop a new Riccati-based methodology for solving these learning
  problems that is amenable to continual learning applications. We also provide some
  corresponding numerical examples that demonstrate the potential computational and
  memory advantages our Riccati-based approach can provide.'
