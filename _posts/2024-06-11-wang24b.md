title: Understanding the Difficulty of Solving Cauchy Problems with PINNs
booktitle: Proceedings of the 6th Annual Learning for Dynamics \& Control Conference
abstract: 'Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have gained popularity in scientific
  computing in recent years. However, they often fail to achieve the same level of
  accuracy as classical methods in solving differential equations. In this paper,
  we aim to understand this issue from two perspectives in the case of Cauchy problems:
  the use of $L^2$ residuals as objective functions and the approximation gap of neural
  networks. We show that minimizing the sum of $L^2$ residual and initial condition
  error is not sufficient to guarantee the true solution, as this loss function does
  not capture the underlying dynamics. Additionally, neural networks are not capable
  of capturing singularities in the solutions due to the non-compactness of their
  image sets. This, in turn, influences the existence of global minima and the regularity
  of the network. We demonstrate that when the global minimum does not exist, machine
  precision becomes the predominant source of achievable error in practice. We also
  present numerical experiments in support of our theoretical claims.'
