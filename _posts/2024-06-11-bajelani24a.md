title: 'From raw data to safety: Reducing conservatism by set expansion'
abstract: In response to safety concerns associated with learning-based algorithms,
  safety filters have been proposed as a modular technique. Generally, these filters
  heavily rely on the system’s model, which is contradictory if they are intended
  to enhance a data-driven or end-to-end learning solution. This paper extends our
  previous work, a purely Data-Driven Safety Filter (DDSF) based on Willems’ lemma,
  to an extremely short-sighted and non-conservative solution. Specifically, we propose
  online and offline sample-based methods to expand the safe set of DDSF and reduce
  its conservatism. Since this method is defined in an input-output framework, it
  can systematically handle both unknown and time-delay LTI systems using only one
  single batch of data. To evaluate its performance, we apply the proposed method
  to a time-delay system under various settings. The simulation results validate the
  effectiveness of the set expansion algorithm in generating a notably large input-output
  safe set, resulting in safety filters that are not conservative, even with an extremely
  short prediction horizon.
