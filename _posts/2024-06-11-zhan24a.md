title: State-Wise Safe Reinforcement Learning with Pixel Observations
booktitle: Proceedings of the 6th Annual Learning for Dynamics \& Control Conference
abstract: In the context of safe exploration, Reinforcement Learning (RL) has long
  grappled with the challenges of balancing the tradeoff between maximizing rewards
  and minimizing safety violations, particularly in complex environments with contact-rich
  or non-smooth dynamics, and when dealing with high-dimensional pixel observations.
  Furthermore, incorporating state-wise safety constraints in the exploration and
  learning process, where the agent must avoid unsafe regions without prior knowledge,
  adds another layer of complexity. In this paper, we propose a novel pixel-observation
  safe RL algorithm that efficiently encodes state-wise safety constraints with unknown
  hazard regions through a newly introduced latent barrier-like function learning
  mechanism. As a joint learning framework, our approach begins by constructing a
  latent dynamics model with low-dimensional latent spaces derived from pixel observations.
  We then build and learn a latent barrier-like function on top of the latent dynamics
  and conduct policy optimization simultaneously, thereby improving both safety and
  the total expected return. Experimental evaluations on the safety-gym benchmark
  suite demonstrate that our proposed method significantly reduces safety violations
  throughout the training process, and demonstrates faster safety convergence compared
  to existing methods while achieving competitive results in reward return.
