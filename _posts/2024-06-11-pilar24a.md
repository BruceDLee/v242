title: Physics-informed Neural Networks with Unknown Measurement Noise
abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) constitute a flexible approach
  to both finding solutions and identifying parameters of partial differential equations.
  Most works on the topic assume noiseless data, or data contaminated with weak Gaussian
  noise. We show that the standard PINN framework breaks down in case of non-Gaussian
  noise. We give a way of resolving this fundamental issue and we propose to jointly
  train an energy-based model (EBM) to learn the correct noise distribution. We illustrate
  the improved performance of our approach using multiple examples.
