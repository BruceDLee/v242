title: Data-Driven Bifurcation Analysis via Learning of Homeomorphism
booktitle: Proceedings of the 6th Annual Learning for Dynamics \& Control Conference
abstract: This work proposes a data-driven approach for bifurcation analysis in nonlinear
  systems when the governing differential equations are not available. Specifically,
  regularized regression with barrier terms is used to learn a homeomorphism that
  transforms the underlying system to a reference linear dynamics â€” either an explicit
  reference model with desired qualitative behavior, or Koopman eigenfunctions that
  are identified from some system data under a reference parameter value. When such
  a homeomorphism fails to be constructed with low error, bifurcation phenomenon is
  detected. A case study is performed on a planar numerical example where a pitchfork
  bifurcation exists.
