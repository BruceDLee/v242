title: A Large Deviations Perspective on Policy Gradient Algorithms
booktitle: Proceedings of the 6th Annual Learning for Dynamics \& Control Conference
abstract: Motivated by policy gradient methods in the context of reinforcement learning,
  we derive the first large deviation rate function for the iterates generated by
  stochastic gradient descent for possibly non-convex objectives satisfying a Polyak-{≈Å}ojasiewicz
  condition. Leveraging the contraction principle from large deviations theory, we
  illustrate the potential of this result by showing how convergence properties of
  policy gradient with a softmax parametrization and an entropy regularized objective
  can be naturally extended to a wide spectrum of other policy parametrizations.
