title: Global Rewards in Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning for Autonomous Mobility
  on Demand Systems
booktitle: Proceedings of the 6th Annual Learning for Dynamics \& Control Conference
abstract: We study vehicle dispatching in autonomous mobility on demand (AMoD) systems,
  where a central operator assigns vehicles to customer requests or rejects these
  with the aim of maximizing its total profit. Recent approaches use multi-agent deep
  reinforcement learning (MADRL) to realize scalable yet performant algorithms, but
  train agents based on local rewards, which distorts the reward signal with respect
  to the system-wide profit, leading to lower performance. We therefore propose a
  novel global-rewards-based MADRL algorithm for vehicle dispatching in AMoD systems,
  which resolves so far existing goal conflicts between the trained agents and the
  operator by assigning rewards to agents leveraging a counterfactual baseline. Our
  algorithm shows statistically significant improvements across various settings on
  real-world data compared to state-of-the-art MADRL algorithms with local rewards.
  We further provide a structural analysis which shows that the utilization of global
  rewards can improve implicit vehicle balancing and demand forecasting abilities.
