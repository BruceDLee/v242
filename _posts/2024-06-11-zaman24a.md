  Perspective'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 6th Annual Learning for Dynamics \& Control Conference
abstract: In this paper, we study the problem of robust cooperative multi-agent reinforcement
  learning (RL) where a large number of cooperative agents with distributed information
  aim to learn policies in the presence of stochastic and non-stochastic uncertainties
  whose distributions are respectively known and unknown. Focusing on policy optimization
  that accounts for both types of uncertainties, we formulate the problem as a worst-case
  (minimax) framework. Since this problem is intractable in general, we focus on the
  Linear Quadratic setting to enable derive benchmark solutions. First, since no standard
  theory exists for this problem due to the distributed information structure, we
  utilize the Mean-Field Type Game (MFTG) paradigm to establish guarantees on the
  solution quality in the sense of achieved Nash equilibrium of the MFTG. This in
  turn allows us to compare the performance against the corresponding original robust
  multi-agent control problem. Then, we propose a Receding-horizon Gradient Descent
  Ascent RL algorithm to find the MFTG Nash equilibrium and we prove a non-asymptotic
  rate of convergence. Finally, we provide numerical experiments to demonstrate the
  efficacy of our approach relative to a baseline algorithm.
