title: Interpretable data-driven model predictive control of building energy systems
  using SHAP
abstract: Advanced building energy system controls, such as model predictive control,
  rely on accurate system models. To reduce the modelling effort in the building sector,
  data-driven models are becoming increasingly popular in research. Despite their
  promising performance, data-driven models are considered black boxes. This black
  box nature is an obstacle to widespread application, as it is difficult for building
  operators to understand how predictions are made. Concepts known as Explainable
  Artificial Intelligence are being developed to improve the interpretability of black
  box models. This work combines the popular Explainable Artificial Intelligence method
  Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) with data-driven model predictive control to
  increase the interpretability of artificial neural networks used as process models
  during model creation. Using a standardised residual building energy system for
  controller testing, an in-depth analysis of how the models make predictions is carried
  out. In addition, the influence of different model setups on the control performance
  is evaluated. The results show that the different control performances can be justified
  by analysing the underlying models with SHAP. SHAP shows how the characteristics
  of a feature affect the prediction and reveals weaknesses in the model. In addition,
  the features can be sorted according to their influence on the prediction, which
  is utilized for feature selection.
