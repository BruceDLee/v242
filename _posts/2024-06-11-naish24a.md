title: Reinforcement Learning-Driven Parametric Curve Fitting for Snake Robot Gait
  Design
booktitle: Proceedings of the 6th Annual Learning for Dynamics \& Control Conference
abstract: Snake-inspired robots demonstrate exceptional versatility through challenging
  terrains such as sand, rubble, and ice. However, their high-dimensional continuous
  action spaces make analytical gait design challenging. Early works by Hirose (1994)
  showed that gait parameterization over low-dimensional spatially and temporally
  varying sine waves can serve as basis functions for the shape-space or central pattern
  generators (CPGs). Recent approaches to designing CPGs have combined annealed chain-fitting,
  which solves for joint angles that fit a snake robot to a desired backbone curve,
  and keyframe extraction, which then fits analytic shape functions to the resulting
  optimized joint angles. However, the non-convex optimization associated with these
  methods is fraught with local optima exacerbated by constraints such as actuator
  limits. Reinforcement Learning has emerged as a promising alternative for searching
  over such spaces. However, end-to-end RL approaches trained purely in simulation
  are vulnerable to reality distribution shifts, lack safety guarantees, and donâ€™t
  yield an intuitive representation of the learned gait. We propose a method that
  translates a gait found via policy search into a parametric representation of its
  component sinusoidal equations thus leveraging the strengths of both learning-based
  and classical approaches. Simulation and hardware experiments show that the proposed
  pipeline can generate parametric gaits where classical curve fitting-based approaches
  fail.
