  Solutions Under Constraints'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 6th Annual Learning for Dynamics \& Control Conference
abstract: At the heart of power system operations, alternating current optimal power
  flow (ACOPF) studies the generation of electric power in the most economical way
  under network-wide load requirement, and can be formulated as a highly structured
  non-convex quadratically constrained quadratic program (QCQP). Optimization-based
  solutions to ACOPF (such as ADMM or interior-point method), as the classic approach,
  require large amount of computation and cannot meet the need to repeatedly solve
  the problem as load requirement frequently changes. On the other hand, learning-based
  methods that directly predict the ACOPF solution given the load input incur little
  computational cost but often generates infeasible solutions (i.e. violate the constraints
  of ACOPF). In this work, we combine the best of both worlds — we propose an innovated
  framework for learning ACOPF, where the input load is mapped to the ACOPF solution
  through a neural network in a computationally efficient and reliable manner. Key
  to our innovation is a specific-purpose “activation function” defined implicitly
  by a QCQP and a novel loss, which enforce constraint satisfaction. We show through
  numerical simulations that our proposed method achieves superior feasibility rate
  and generation cost in situations where the existing learning-based approaches fail.
