title: Data-driven robust covariance control for uncertain linear systems
abstract: The theory of covariance control and covariance steering (CS) deals with
  controlling the dispersion of trajectories of a dynamical system, under the implicit
  assumption that accurate prior knowledge of the system being controlled is available.
  In this work, we consider the problem of steering the distribution of a discrete-time,
  linear system subject to exogenous disturbances under an unknown dynamics model.
  Leveraging concepts from behavioral systems theory, the trajectories of this unknown,
  noisy system may be (approximately) represented using system data collected through
  experimentation. Using this fact, we formulate a direct data-driven covariance control
  problem using input-state data. We then propose a maximum likelihood uncertainty
  quantification method to estimate and bound the noise realizations in the data collection
  process. Lastly, we utilize robust convex optimization techniques to solve the resulting
  norm-bounded uncertain convex program. We illustrate the proposed end-to-end data-driven
  CS algorithm on a double integrator example and showcase the efficacy and accuracy
  of the proposed method compared to that of model-based methods.
