title: Piecewise regression via mixed-integer programming for MPC
abstract: Piecewise regression is a versatile approach used in various disciplines
  to approximate complex functions from limited, potentially noisy data points. In
  control, piecewise regression is, e.g., used to approximate the optimal control
  law of model predictive control (MPC), the optimal value function, or unknown system
  dynamics. Neural networks are a common choice to solve the piecewise regression
  problem. However, due to their nonlinear structure, training is often based on gradient-based
  methods, which may fail to find a global optimum or even a solution that leads to
  a small approximation error. To overcome this problem and to find a global optimal
  solution, methods based on mixed-integer programming (MIP) can be used. However,
  the known MIP-based methods are either limited to a special class of functions,
  e.g., convex piecewise affine functions, or they lead to complex approximations
  in terms of the number of regions of the piecewise defined function. Both complicate
  a usage in the framework of control. We propose a new MIP-based method that is not
  restricted to a particular class of piecewise defined functions and leads to functions
  that are fast to evaluate and can be used within an optimization problem, making
  them well suited for use in control.
