title: HSVI-based online minimax strategies for partially observable stochastic games
  with neural perception mechanisms
abstract: We consider a variant of continuous-state partially-observable stochastic
  games with neural perception mechanisms and an asymmetric information structure.
  One agent has partial information, with the observation function implemented as
  a neural network, while the other agent is assumed to have full knowledge of the
  state. We present, for the first time, an efficient online method to compute an
  $\varepsilon$-minimax strategy profile, which requires only one linear program to
  be solved for each agent at every stage, instead of a complex estimation of opponent
  counterfactual values. For the partially-informed agent, we propose a continual
  resolving approach which uses lower bounds, pre-computed offline with heuristic
  search value iteration (HSVI), instead of opponent counterfactual values. This inherits
  the soundness of continual resolving at the cost of pre-computing the bound. For
  the fully-informed agent, we propose an inferred-belief strategy, where the agent
  maintains an inferred belief about the belief of the partially-informed agent based
  on (offline) upper bounds from HSVI, guaranteeing $\varepsilon$-distance to the
  value of the game at the initial belief known to both agents.
