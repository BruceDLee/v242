title: Real-World Fluid Directed Rigid Body Control via Deep Reinforcement Learning
abstract: Recent advances in real-world applications of reinforcement learning (RL)
  have relied on the ability to accurately simulate systems at scale. However, domains
  such as fluid dynamical systems exhibit complex dynamic phenomena that are hard
  to simulate at high integration rates, limiting the direct application of modern
  deep RL algorithms to often expensive or safety critical hardware. In this work,
  we introduce “Box o’ Flows”, a novel benchtop experimental control system for systematically
  evaluating RL algorithms in dynamic real-world scenarios. We describe the key components
  of the Box o’ Flows, and through a series of experiments demonstrate how state-of-the-art
  model-free RL algorithms can synthesize a variety of complex behaviors via simple
  reward specifications. Furthermore, we explore the role of offline RL in data-efficient
  hypothesis testing by reusing past experiences. We believe that the insights gained
  from this preliminary study and the availability of systems like the Box o’ Flows
  support the way forward for developing systematic RL algorithms that can be generally
  applied to complex, dynamical systems. Supplementary material and videos of experiments
