title: Finite-Time Complexity of Incremental Policy Gradient Methods for Solving Multi-Task
  Reinforcement Learning
booktitle: Proceedings of the 6th Annual Learning for Dynamics \& Control Conference
abstract: We consider a multi-task learning problem, where an agent is presented a
  number of $N$ reinforcement learning tasks. To solve this problem, we are interested
  in studying the gradient approach, which iteratively updates an estimate of the
  optimal policy using the gradients of the value functions. The classic policy gradient
  method, however, may be expensive to implement in the multi-task settings as it
  requires access to the gradients of all the tasks at every iteration. To circumvent
  this issue, in this paper we propose to study an incremental policy gradient method,
  where the agent only uses the gradient of only one task at each iteration. Our main
  contribution is to provide theoretical results to characterize the performance of
  the proposed method. In particular, we show that incremental policy gradient methods
  converge to the optimal value of the multi-task reinforcement learning objectives
  at a sublinear rate $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{k})$, where $k$ is the number of iterations.
  To illustrate its performance, we apply the proposed method to solve a simple multi-task
  variant of GridWorld problems, where an agent seeks to find an policy to navigate
  effectively in different environments.
