title: MPC-inspired reinforcement learning for verifiable model-free control
abstract: In this paper, we introduce a new class of parameterized controllers, drawing
  inspiration from Model Predictive Control (MPC). These controllers adopt an unrolled
  Quadratic Programming (QP) solver, structured similarly to a deep neural network,
  with parameters from the QP problem that is similar to linear MPC. The parameters
  are learned rather than derived from models. This approach addresses the limitations
  of commonly learned controllers with Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) or other general
  neural network architecture in deep reinforcement learning, in terms of explainability
  and performance guarantees. The learned controllers not only possess verifiable
  properties like persistent feasibility and asymptotic stability akin to MPC, but
  they also empirically match MPC and MLP controllers in control performance. Moreover,
  they are more computationally efficient in implementation compared to MPC and require
  significantly fewer learnable policy parameters than MLP controllers. Practical
  application is demonstrated through a vehicle drift maneuvering task, showcasing
  the potential of these controllers in real-world scenarios.
