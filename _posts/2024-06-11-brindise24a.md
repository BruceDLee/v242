title: Pointwise-in-Time Diagnostics for Reinforcement Learning During Training and
  Runtime
abstract: Explainable AI Planning (XAIP), a subfield of xAI, offers a variety of methods
  to interpret the behavior of autonomous systems. A recent “pointwise-in-time” explanation
  method, called Rule Status Assessment (RSA), characterizes an agent’s behavior at
  individual time steps in a trajectory using linear temporal logic (LTL) rules. In
  this work, RSA is applied for the first time in a reinforcement learning (RL) context.
  We first demonstrate RSA diagnostics as a substantial supplement to the basic RL
  reward curve, tracking whether and when specified subtasks are accomplished. We
  then introduce a novel “Interactive RSA” which provides the user with detailed diagnostic
  information automatically at any desired point in a trajectory. We apply RSA to
  an advanced agent at runtime and show that RSA and its novel interactive variant
  constitute a promising step towards explainable RL.
