title: Multi-agent assignment via state augmented reinforcement learning
booktitle: Proceedings of the 6th Annual Learning for Dynamics \& Control Conference
abstract: We address the conflicting requirements of a multi-agent assignment problem
  through constrained reinforcement learning, emphasizing the inadequacy of standard
  regularization techniques for this purpose. Instead, we recur to a state augmentation
  approach in which the oscillation of dual variables is exploited by agents to alternate
  between tasks. In addition, we coordinate the actions of the multiple agents acting
  on their local states through these multipliers, which are gossiped through a communication
  network, eliminating the need to access other agent states. By these means, we propose
  a distributed multi-agent assignment protocol with theoretical feasibility guarantees
  that we corroborate in a monitoring numerical experiment.
