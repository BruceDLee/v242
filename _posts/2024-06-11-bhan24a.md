title: 'PDE Control Gym: A Benchmark for Data-Driven Boundary Control of Partial Differential
  Equations'
abstract: Over the last decade, data-driven methods have surged in popularity, emerging
  as valuable tools for control theory. As such, neural network approximations of
  control feedback laws, system dynamics, and even Lyapunov functions have attracted
  growing attention. With the ascent of learning based control, the need for accurate,
  fast, and easy-to-use benchmarks has increased. In this work, we present the first
  learning-based environment for boundary control of PDEs. In our benchmark, we introduce
  three foundational PDE problems — a 1D transport PDE, a 1D reaction-diffusion PDE,
  and a 2D Navier–Stokes PDE — whose solvers are bundled in an user-friendly reinforcement
  learning gym. With this gym, we then present the first set of model-free, reinforcement
  learning algorithms for solving this series of benchmark problems, achieving stability,
  although at a higher cost compared to model-based PDE backstepping. With the set
  of benchmark environments and detailed examples, this work significantly lowers
  the barrier to entry for learning-based PDE control — a topic largely unexplored
  by the data-driven control community. The entire benchmark is available on Github
  along with detailed documentation and the presented reinforcement learning models
  are open sourced.
