title: Probabilistic ODE Solvers for Integration Error-Aware Numerical Optimal Control
booktitle: Proceedings of the 6th Annual Learning for Dynamics \& Control Conference
abstract: Appropriate time discretization is crucial for real-time applications of
  numerical optimal control, such as nonlinear model predictive control. However,
  if the discretization error strongly depends on the applied control input, meeting
  accuracy and sampling time requirements simultaneously can be challenging using
  classical discretization methods. In particular, neither fixed-grid nor adaptive-grid
  discretizations may be suitable, when they suffer from large integration error or
  exceed the prescribed sampling time, respectively. In this work, we take a first
  step at closing this gap by utilizing probabilistic numerical integrators to approximate
  the solution of the initial value problem, as well as the computational uncertainty
  associated with it, inside the optimal control problem (OCP). By taking the viewpoint
  of probabilistic numerics and propagating the numerical uncertainty in the cost,
  the OCP is reformulated such that the optimal input reduces the computational uncertainty
  insofar as it is beneficial for the control objective. The proposed approach is
  illustrated using a numerical example, and potential benefits and limitations are
  discussed.
