title: Efficient Imitation Learning with Conservative World Models
abstract: We tackle the problem of policy learning from expert demonstrations without
  a reward function. A central challenge in this space is that these policies fail
  upon deployment due to issues of distributional shift, environment stochasticity,
  or compounding errors. Adversarial imitation learning alleviates this issue but
  requires additional on-policy training samples for stability, which presents a challenge
  in realistic domains due to inefficient learning and high sample complexity. One
  approach to this issue is to learn a world model of the environment, and use synthetic
  data for policy training. While successful in prior works, we argue that this is
  sub-optimal due to additional distribution shifts between the learned model and
  the real environment. Instead, we re-frame imitation learning as a fine-tuning problem,
  rather than a pure reinforcement learning one. Drawing theoretical connections to
  offline RL and fine-tuning algorithms, we argue that standard online world model
  algorithms are not well suited to the imitation learning problem. We derive a principled
  conservative optimization bound and demonstrate empirically that it leads to improved
  performance on two very challenging manipulation environments form high-dimensional
  raw pixel observations. We set a new state-of-the-art performance on the Franka
  Kitchen environment from images, requiring only 10 demos on no reward labels, as
  well as solving a complex dexterity manipulation task.
