title: A learning-based framework to adapt legged robots on-the-fly to unexpected
  disturbances
abstract: 'State-of-the-art control methods for legged robots demonstrate impressive
  performance and robustness on a variety of terrains. Still, these approaches often
  lack an ability to learn how to adapt to changing conditions online. Such adaptation
  is especially critical if the robot encounters an environment with dynamics different
  than those considered in its model or in prior offline training. This paper proposes
  a learning-based framework that allows a walking robot to stabilize itself under
  disturbances neglected by its base controller. We consider an approach that simplifies
  the learning problem into two tasks: learning a model to estimate the robotâ€™s steady-state
  response and learning a dynamics model for the system near its steady-state behavior.
  Through experiments with the MIT Mini Cheetah, we show that we can learn these models
  offline in simulation and transfer them to the real world, optionally finetuning
  them as the robot collects data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach
  by applying it to stabilize the quadruped as it carries a box of water on its back.'
