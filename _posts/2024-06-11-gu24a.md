title: 'Proto-MPC: An Encoder-Prototype-Decoder Approach for Quadrotor Control in
  Challenging Winds'
abstract: Quadrotors are increasingly used in the evolving field of aerial robotics
  for their agility and mechanical simplicity. However, inherent uncertainties, such
  as aerodynamic effects coupled with quadrotors’ operation in dynamically changing
  environments, pose significant challenges for traditional, nominal model-based control
  designs. To address these challenges, we propose a multi-task meta-learning method
  called Encoder-Prototype-Decoder (EPD), which has the advantage of effectively balancing
  shared and distinctive representations across diverse training tasks. Subsequently,
  we integrate the EPD model into a model predictive control problem (Proto-MPC) to
  enhance the quadrotor’s ability to adapt and operate across a spectrum of dynamically
  changing tasks with an efficient online implementation. We validate the proposed
  method in simulations, which demonstrates Proto-MPC’s robust performance in trajectory
  tracking of a quadrotor being subject to static and spatially varying side winds.
