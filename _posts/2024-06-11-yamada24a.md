title: Efficient Skill Acquisition for Insertion Tasks in Obstructed Environments
abstract: Data efficiency in robotic skill acquisition is crucial for operating robots
  in varied small-batch assembly settings. To operate in such environments, robots
  must have robust obstacle avoidance and versatile goal conditioning acquired from
  only a few simple demonstrations. Existing approaches, however, fall short of these
  requirements. Deep reinforcement learning (RL) enables a robot to learn complex
  manipulation tasks but is often limited to small task spaces in the real world due
  to sample inefficiency and safety concerns. Motion planning (MP) can generate collision-free
  paths in obstructed environments, but cannot solve complex manipulation tasks and
  requires goal states often specified by a user or object-specific pose estimator.
  In this work, we propose a robust system for efficient skill acquisition designed
  to address complex insertion tasks in obstructed environments. Our system leverages
  an object-centric generative model (OCGM) for versatile goal identification to specify
  a goal for MP combined with RL to solve complex manipulation tasks in obstructed
  environments. Particularly, OCGM enables one-shot target object identification and
  re-identification in new scenes, allowing MP to guide the robot to the target object
  while avoiding obstacles. This is combined with a skill transition network, which
  bridges the gap between terminal states of MP and feasible start states of a sample-efficient
  RL policy. The experiments demonstrate that our OCGM-based one-shot goal identification
  provides competitive accuracy to other baseline approaches and that our modular
  framework outperforms competitive baselines, including a state-of-the-art RL algorithm,
  by a significant margin for complex manipulation tasks in obstructed environments.
