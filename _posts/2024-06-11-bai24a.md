title: Mixing Classifiers to Alleviate the Accuracy-Robustness Trade-Off
booktitle: Proceedings of the 6th Annual Learning for Dynamics \& Control Conference
abstract: Deep neural classifiers have recently found tremendous success in data-driven
  control systems. However, existing neural models often suffer from a trade-off between
  accuracy and adversarial robustness, which is a limitation that must be overcome
  in the control of safety-critical systems that require both high performance and
  rigorous robustness guarantees. In this work, we develop classifiers that simultaneously
  inherit high robustness from robust models and high accuracy from standard models.
  Specifically, we propose a theoretically motivated formulation that mixes the output
  probabilities of a standard neural network and a robust neural network. Both of
  these base classifiers are pre-trained, and thus our method does not require additional
  training. Our numerical experiments verify that the mixed classifier noticeably
  improves the accuracy-robustness trade-off and identify the confidence property
  of the robust base classifier as the key leverage of this more benign trade-off.
  Our theoretical results prove that under mild assumptions, when the robustness of
  the robust base model is certifiable, no alteration or attack within a closed-form
  $l_p$ radius on an input can result in misclassification of the mixed classifier.
