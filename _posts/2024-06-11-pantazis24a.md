title: Probably approximately correct stability of allocations in uncertain coalitional
  games with private sampling
abstract: We study coalitional games with exogenous uncertainty in the coalition value,
  in which each agent is allowed to have private samples of the uncertainty. As a
  consequence, the agents may have a different perception of stability of the grand
  coalition. In this context, we propose a novel methodology to study the out-of-sample
  coalitional rationality of allocations in the set of stable allocations (i.e., the
  core). Our analysis builds on the framework of probably approximately correct learning.
  Initially, we state a priori and a posteriori guarantees for the entire core. Furthermore,
  we provide a distributed algorithm to compute a compression set that determines
  the generalization properties of the a posteriori statements. We then refine our
  probabilistic robustness bounds by specialising the analysis to a single payoff
  allocation, taking, also in this case, both a priori and a posteriori approaches.
  Finally, we consider a relaxed zeta-core to include nearby allocations and also
  address the case of empty core. For this case, probabilistic statements are given
  on the eventual stability of allocations in the zeta-core.
