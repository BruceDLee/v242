title: Neural processes with event triggers for fast adaptation to changes
abstract: Traditionally, first-principle models are used to monitor and control dynamical
  systems. However, modeling complex systems using first principles can be challenging.
  Learning the dynamics from data using neural networks has emerged as a viable alternative.
  In practice, some parameters of a system may vary across different system instances,
  but training separate neural networks for all possible parameter combinations can
  be infeasible. Therefore, meta-learning using, e.g., conditional neural processes
  (CNPs), aims to learn a prior model over the system dynamics for various parameters.
  These models can then adapt on deployment to the parameters of a system instance
  using a context set composed of past observations. However, changes in parameters
  can also occur online during operation and naively adding past observations across
  parameter variations to the context set can distort the model’s latent representation,
  leading to inaccurate predictions over time. This paper introduces an adaptation
  scheme to enable CNPs to cope with such online variations. We combine a sliding
  window to accommodate gradual variations with the use of event triggers to detect
  sudden changes. The event triggers are based on concentration inequalities, they
  reset the context set of the CNP once observations deviate significantly from the
  CNP’s predictions. We validate our concepts on two nonlinear dynamical systems under
  parameter variations and demonstrate that our approaches decrease the prediction
  error over time as well as their efficacy for control.
