title: Real-time safe control of neural network dynamic models with sound approximation
abstract: Safe control of neural network dynamic models (NNDMs) is important to robotics
  and many applications. However, it remains challenging to compute an optimal safe
  control in real time for NNDM. To enable real-time computation, we propose to use
  a sound approximation of the NNDM in the control synthesis. In particular, we propose
  Bernstein over-approximated neural dynamics (BOND) based on the Bernstein polynomial
  over-approximation (BPO) of ReLU activation functions in NNDM. To mitigate the errors
  introduced by the approximation and to ensure persistent feasibility of the safe
  control problems, we synthesize a worst-case safety index using the most unsafe
  approximated state within the BPO relaxation of NNDM offline. For the online real-time
  optimization, we formulate the first-order Taylor approximation of the nonlinear
  worst-case safety constraint as an additional linear layer of NNDM with the l2 bounded
  bias term for the higher-order remainder. Comprehensive experiments with different
  neural dynamics and safety constraints show that with safety guaranteed, our NNDMs
  with sound approximation are 10-100 times faster than the safe control baseline
  that uses mixed integer programming (MIP), validating the effectiveness of the worst-case
  safety index and scalability of the proposed BOND in real-time large-scale settings.
