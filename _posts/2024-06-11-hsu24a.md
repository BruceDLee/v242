title: Robust Exploration with Adversary via Langevin Monte Carlo
booktitle: Proceedings of the 6th Annual Learning for Dynamics \& Control Conference
abstract: In the realm of Deep Q-Networks (DQNs), numerous exploration strategies
  have demonstrated efficacy within controlled environments. However, these methods
  encounter formidable challenges when confronted with the unpredictability of real-world
  scenarios marked by disturbances. The optimization of exploration efficiency under
  such disturbances is not fully investigated. In response to these challenges, this
  work introduces a versatile reinforcement learning (RL) framework that systematically
  addresses the intricate interplay between exploration and robustness in dynamic
  and unpredictable environments. We propose a robust RL methodology, framed within
  a two-player max-min adversarial paradigm. This formulation is cast as a Probabilistic
  Action Robust Markov Decision Process (MDP), grounded in a cyber-physical perspective.
  Our methodology capitalizes on Langevin Monte Carlo (LMC) for Q-function exploration,
  facilitating iterative updates that empower both the protagonist and adversary to
  efficaciously explore. Notably, we extend this adversarial training paradigm to
  encompass robustness against delayed feedback episodes. Empirical evaluation, conducted
  on benchmark problems such as N-Chain and deep brain stimulation, underlines the
  consistent superiority of our method over baseline approaches across diverse perturbation
  scenarios and instances of delayed feedback.
