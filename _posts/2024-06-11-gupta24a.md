title: Uncertainty Informed Optimal Resource Allocation with Gaussian Process based
  Bayesian Inference
booktitle: Proceedings of the 6th Annual Learning for Dynamics \& Control Conference
abstract: 'We focus on the problem of uncertainty informed allocation of medical resources
  (vaccines) to heterogeneous populations for managing epidemic spread. We tackle
  two related questions: (1) For a compartmental ordinary differential equation (ODE)
  model of epidemic spread, how can we estimate and integrate parameter uncertainty
  into resource allocation decisions? (2) How can we computationally handle both nonlinear
  ODE constraints and parameter uncertainties for a generic stochastic optimization
  problem for resource allocation? To the best of our knowledge current literature
  does not fully resolve these questions. Here, we develop a data-driven approach
  to represent parameter uncertainty accurately and tractably in a novel stochastic
  optimization problem formulation. We first generate a tractable scenario set by
  estimating the distribution on ODE model parameters using Bayesian inference with
  Gaussian processes. Next, we develop a parallelized solution algorithm that accounts
  for scenario-dependent nonlinear ODE constraints. Our scenario-set generation procedure
  and solution approach are flexible in that they can handle any compartmental epidemiological
  ODE model. Our computational experiments on two different non-linear ODE models
  (SEIR and SEPIHR) indicate that accounting for uncertainty in key epidemiological
  parameters can improve the efficacy of time-critical allocation decisions by 4-8%.
  This improvement can be attributed to data-driven and optimal (strategic) nature
  of vaccine allocations.'
