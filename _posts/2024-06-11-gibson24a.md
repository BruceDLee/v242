title: 'Hacking Predictors Means Hacking Cars: Using Sensitivity Analysis to Identify
  Trajectory Prediction Vulnerabilities for Autonomous Driving Security'
booktitle: Proceedings of the 6th Annual Learning for Dynamics \& Control Conference
abstract: Adversarial attacks on learning-based multi-modal trajectory predictors
  have already been demonstrated. However, there are still open questions about the
  effects of perturbations on inputs other than state histories, and how these attacks
  impact downstream planning and control. In this paper, we conduct a sensitivity
  analysis on two trajectory prediction models, Trajectron++ and AgentFormer. The
  analysis reveals that between all inputs, almost all of the perturbation sensitivities
  for both models lie only within the most recent position and velocity states. We
  additionally demonstrate that, despite dominant sensitivity on state history perturbations,
  an undetectable image map perturbation made with the Fast Gradient Sign Method can
  induce large prediction error increases in both models, revealing that these trajectory
  predictors are, in fact, susceptible to image-based attacks. Using an optimization-based
  planner and example perturbations crafted from sensitivity results, we show how
  these attacks can cause a vehicle to come to a sudden stop from moderate driving
  speeds.
